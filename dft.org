* Introduction to this book
This book serves two purposes: 1) to provide worked examples of using DFT to model materials properties, and 2) to provide references to more advanced treatments of these topics in the literature. It is not a definitive reference on density functional theory. Along the way to learning how to perform the calculations, you will learn how to analyze the data, make plots, and how to interpret the results. This book is very much "recipe" oriented, with the intention of giving you enough information and knowledge to start your research. In that sense, many of the computations are not publication quality with respect to convergence of calculation parameters.

You will read a lot of python code in this book. I believe that computational work should always be scripted. Scripting provides a written record of everything you have done, making it more probable you (or others) could reproduce your results or report the method of its execution exactly at a later time.

This book makes heavy use of many computational tools including:

A comprehensive overview of DFT is beyond the scope of this book, as excellent reviews on these subjects are readily found in the literature, and are suggested reading in the following paragraph.  Instead, this chapter is intended to provide a useful starting point for a non-expert to begin learning about and using DFT in the manner used in this book. Much of the information presented here is standard knowledge among experts, but a consequence of this is that it is rarely discussed in current papers in the literature. A secondary goal of this chapter is to provide new users with a path through the extensive literature available and to point out potential difficulties and pitfalls in these calculations.


A modern and practical introduction to density functional theory can be found in Sholl and Steckel cite:sholl-2009-densit-funct-theor. A fairly standard textbook on DFT is the one written by Parr and Yang cite:parr-yang.  The Chemist's Guide to DFT cite:koch2001 is more readable and contains more practical information for running calculations, but both of these books focus on molecular systems.  The standard texts in solid state physics are by Kittel cite:kittel and Ashcroft and Mermin cite:ashcroft-mermin. Both have their fine points, the former being more mathematically rigorous and the latter more readable.  However, neither of these books is particularly easy to relate to chemistry.  For this, one should consult the exceptionally clear writings of Roald Hoffman cite:hoffmann1987,RevModPhys.60.601, and follow these with the work of N\o rskov and coworkers cite:hammer2000:adv-cat,greeley2002:elect.

In this chapter, only the elements of DFT that are relevant to this work will be discussed.  An excellent review on other implementations of DFT can be found in Reference citealp:freeman1995:densit, and details on the various algorithms used in DFT codes can be found in Refs.  citealp:payne1992:iterat,Kresse199615.

One of the most useful sources of information has been the dissertations of other students, perhaps because the difficulties they faced in learning the material are still fresh in their minds. Thomas Bligaard, a coauthor of Dacapo, wrote a particularly relevant thesis on exchange/correlation functionals cite:bligaard2000:exchan-correl-funct and a dissertation illustrating the use of DFT to design new alloys with desirable thermal and mechanical properties cite:bligaard2003:under-mater-proper-basis-densit.  The Ph.D.  thesis of Ari Seitsonen contains several useful appendices on k-point setups, and convergence tests of calculations, in addition to a thorough description of DFT and analysis of calculation output cite:seitsonen2000:phd. Finally, another excellent overview of DFT and its applications to bimetallic alloy phase diagrams and surface reactivity is presented in the PhD thesis of Robin Hirschl cite:hirschl2002:binar-trans-metal-alloy-their-surfac.

In 1926, Erwin Schr\ouml{}dinger published the first accounts of his now famous wave equation cite:pauling1963. He later shared the Nobel prize with Paul A. M. Dirac in 1933 for this discovery. Schr\ouml{}dinger's wave function seemed extremely promising, as it contains all of the information available about a system. Unfortunately, most practical systems of interest consist of many interacting electrons, and the effort required to find solutions to Schr\ouml{}dinger's equation increases exponentially with the number of electrons, limiting this approach to systems with a small number of relevant electrons, $N \lesssim O(10)$ cite:RevModPhys.71.1253. Even if this rough estimate is off by an order of magnitude, a system with 100 electrons is still very small, for example, two Ru atoms if all the electrons are counted, or perhaps ten Pt atoms if only the valence electrons are counted. Thus, the wave function method, which has been extremely successful in studying the properties of small molecules, is unsuitable for studies of large, extended solids. Interestingly, this difficulty was recognized by Dirac as early as 1929, when he wrote "The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble."  cite:dirac1929:quant-mechan-many-elect-system.

In 1964, Hohenberg and Kohn showed that the ground state total energy of a system of interacting electrons is a unique functional of the electron density cite:PhysRev.136.B864. By definition, a function returns a number when given a number. For example, in $f(x)=x^2$, $f(x)$ is the function, and it equals four when $x=2$. A functional returns a number when given a function. Thus, in $g(f(x))=\int_0^\pi f(x) dx$, $g(f(x))$ is the functional, and it is equal to two when $f(x)=\sin(x)$. Hohenberg and Kohn further identified a variational principle that appeared to reduce the problem of finding the ground state energy of an electron gas in an external potential (i.e., in the presence of ion cores) to that of the minimization of a functional of the three-dimensional density function.  Unfortunately, the definition of the functional involved a set of 3N-dimensional trial wave functions.

In 1965, Kohn and Sham made a significant breakthrough when they showed that the problem of many interacting electrons in an external potential can be mapped exactly to a set of noninteracting electrons in an effective external potential cite:PhysRev.140.A1133.  This led to a set of self-consistent, single particle equations known as the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations:

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}\label{eq:KS}
\biggl(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 + v_{eff}(\mathbf{r}) -\epsilon_j \biggr) \varphi_j (\mathbf{r})=0,
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
with

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}\label{eq:veff}
v_{eff}(\mathbf{r})=v(\mathbf{r})+\int \frac{n(\mathbf{r'})}{|\mathbf{r-r'}|}d\mathbf{r'} + v_{xc}(\mathbf{r}),
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX

where $v(\mathbf{r})$ is the external potential and $v_{xc}(\mathbf{r})$ is the exchange-correlation potential, which depends on the entire density function. Thus, the density needs to be known in order to define the effective potential so that Eq. eqref:eq:KS can be solved.  $\varphi_j(\mathbf{r})$ corresponds to the $j^{th}$ KS orbital of energy $\epsilon_j$.

The ground state density is given by:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}\label{eq:density} \displaystyle n(\mathbf{r})=\sum_{j=1}^{N}|\varphi_j(\mathbf{r})|^2
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
To solve Eq. \eqref{eq:KS} then, an initial guess is used for $\varphi_j(r)$ which is used to generate Eq. \eqref{eq:density}, which is subsequently used in Eq. \eqref{eq:veff}. This equation is then solved for $\varphi_j(\mathbf{r})$ iteratively until the $\varphi_j(\mathbf{r})$ that result from the solution are the same as the $\varphi_j(\mathbf{r})$ that are used to define the equations, that is, the solutions are self-consistent.  Finally, the ground state energy is given by:

#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dftEnergy}
\displaystyle
E=\sum_j\epsilon_j + E_{xc}[n(\mathbf{r})]-\int v_{xc}(\mathbf{r}) n(\mathbf{r}) d\mathbf{r}
  -\frac{1}{2}\int{\frac{n(\mathbf{r})n(\mathbf{r'})}{|\mathbf{r-r'}|}d\mathbf{r'}\mathbf{r}},
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
where $E_{xc}[n(\mathbf{r})]$ is the exchange-correlation energy functional.  Walter Kohn shared the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1998 for this work cite:RevModPhys.71.1253. The other half of the prize went to John Pople for his efforts in wave function based quantum mechanical methods cite:RevModPhys.71.1267.  Provided the exchange-correlation energy functional is known, Eq.  (ref:eq:dftEnergy) is exact.  However, the exact form of the exchange-correlation energy functional is not known, thus approximations for this functional must be used.

** Exchange correlation functionals

The two main types of exchange/correlation functionals used in DFT are the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). In the LDA, the exchange-correlation functional is defined for an electron in a uniform electron gas of density $n$ cite:PhysRev.140.A1133. It is exact for a uniform electron gas, and is anticipated to be a reasonable approximation for slowly varying densities. In molecules and solids, however, the density tends to vary substantially in space. Despite this, the LDA has been very successfully used in many systems. It tends to predict overbonding in both molecular and solid systems cite:fuchs1998:pseud, and it tends to make semiconductor systems too metallic (the band gap problem) cite:perdew1982:elect-kohn-sham.

The generalized gradient approximation includes corrections for gradients in the electron density, and is often implemented as a corrective function of the LDA.  The form of this corrective function, or "exchange enhancement" function determines which functional it is, e.g. PBE, RPBE, revPBE, etc. cite:hammer1999:improv-pbe. In this book the PBE GGA functional is used the most. N\o{}rskov and coworkers have found that the RPBE functional gives superior chemisorption energies for atomic and molecular bonding to surfaces, but that it gives worse bulk properties, such as lattice constants compared to experimental data cite:hammer1999:improv-pbe.

Finally, there are increasingly new types of functionals in the literature. The so-called hybrid functionals, such as B3LYP, are more popular with gaussian basis sets (e.g. in Gaussian), but they are presently inefficient with planewave basis sets. None of these other types of functionals were used in this work. For more details see Chapter 6 in Ref. citealp:koch2001 and Thomas Bligaard's thesis on exchange and correlation functionals cite:bligaard2000:exchan-correl-funct.

** Basis sets
Briefly, VASP utilizes planewaves as the basis set to expand the
Kohn-Sham orbitals.  In a periodic solid, one can use Bloch's theorem
to show that the wave function for an electron can be expressed as the
product of a planewave and a function with the periodicity of the
lattice cite:ashcroft-mermin:
\begin{equation}
\psi_{n\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r})=\exp({i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}})u_{n\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r})
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{r}$ is a position vector, and $\mathbf{k}$ is a so-called wave vector that will only have certain allowed values defined by the size of the unit cell. Bloch's theorem sets the stage for using planewaves as a basis set, because it suggests a planewave character of the wave function. If the periodic function $u_{n\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r})$ is also expanded in terms of planewaves determined by wave vectors of the reciprocal lattice vectors, $\mathbf{G}$, then the wave function can be expressed completely in terms of a sum of planewaves cite:payne1992:iterat:

\begin{equation}
\psi_i(\mathbf{r})=\sum_\mathbf{G} c_{i,\mathbf{k+G}} \exp(i\mathbf{(k+G)\cdot r}).
\end{equation}

where $c_{i,\mathbf{k+G}}$ are now coefficients that can be varied to determine the lowest energy solution. This also converts Eq.  eqref:eq:KS from an integral equation to a set of algebraic equations that can readily be solved using matrix algebra.

In aperiodic systems, such as systems with even one defect, or randomly ordered alloys, there is no periodic unit cell. Instead one must represent the portion of the system of interest in a supercell, which is then subjected to the periodic boundary conditions so that a planewave basis set can be used. It then becomes necessary to ensure the supercell is large enough to avoid interactions between the defects in neighboring supercells. The case of the randomly ordered alloy is virtually hopeless as the energy of different configurations will fluctuate statistically about an average value.  These systems were not considered in this work, and for more detailed discussions the reader is referred to Ref. citealp:makov1995:period-bound-condit.  Once a supercell is chosen, however, Bloch's theorem can be applied to the new artificially periodic system.

To get a perfect expansion, one needs an infinite number of planewaves.  Luckily, the coefficients of the planewaves must go to zero for high energy planewaves, otherwise the energy of the wave function would go to infinity. This provides justification for truncating the planewave basis set above a cutoff energy. Careful testing of the effect of the cutoff energy on the total energy can be done to determine a suitable cutoff energy. The cutoff energy required to obtain a particular convergence precision is also element dependent, shown in Table ref:tab:pwcut. It can also vary with the "softness" of the pseudopotential.  Thus, careful testing should be done to ensure the desired level of convergence of properties in different systems. Table ref:tab:pwcut refers to convergence of total energies. These energies are rarely considered directly, it is usually differences in energy that are important. These tend to converge with the planewave cutoff energy much more quickly than total energies, due to cancellations of convergence errors.  In this work, 350 eV was found to be suitable for the H adsorption calculations, but a cutoff energy of 450 eV was required for O adsorption calculations.

#+caption: Planewave cutoff energies (in eV) required for different convergence precisions for two different elements with different pseudopotential setups. label:tab:pwcut
| Precision |  Low | High |
|-----------+------+------|
| Mo        |  168 |  293 |
| O         |  300 |  520 |
| O_sv      | 1066 | 1847 |

Bloch's theorem eliminates the need to calculate an infinite number of wave functions, because there are only a finite number of electrons in the unit (super) cell. However, there are still an infinite number of discrete $\mathbf{k}$ points that must be considered, and the energy of the unit cell is calculated as an integral over these points.  It turns out that wave functions at $\mathbf{k}$ points that are close together are similar, thus an interpolation scheme can be used with a finite number of $\mathbf{k}$ points. This also converts the integral used to determine the energy into a sum over the $\mathbf{k}$ points, which are suitably weighted to account for the finite number of them.  There will be errors in the total energy associated with the finite number of $\mathbf{k}$, but these can be reduced and tested for convergence by using higher $\mathbf{k}$-point densities. An excellent discussion of this for aperiodic systems can be found in Ref.  citealp:makov1995:period-bound-condit.

The most common schemes for generating $\mathbf{k}$ points are the Chadi-Cohen scheme cite:PhysRevB.8.5747, and the Monkhorst-Pack scheme cite:PhysRevB.13.5188. The use of these $\mathbf{k}$ point setups amounts to an expansion of the periodic function in reciprocal space, which allows a straight-forward interpolation of the function between the points that is more accurate than with other $\mathbf{k}$ point generation schemes cite:PhysRevB.13.5188.

** Pseudopotentials
The core electrons of an atom are computationally expensive with planewave basis sets because they are highly localized. This means that a very large number of planewaves are required to expand their wave functions. Furthermore, the contributions of the core electrons to bonding compared to those of the valence electrons is usually negligible. In fact, the primary role of the core electron wave functions is to ensure proper orthogonality between the valence electrons and core states.  Consequently, it is desirable to replace the atomic potential due to the core electrons with a pseudopotential that has the same effect on the valence electrons cite:PhysRevB.43.1993. There are essentially two kinds of pseudopotentials, norm-conserving soft pseudopotentials cite:PhysRevB.43.1993 and Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials cite:PhysRevB.41.7892. In either case, the pseudopotential function is generated from an all-electron calculation of an atom in some reference state. In norm-conserving pseudopotentials, the charge enclosed in the pseudopotential region is the same as that enclosed by the same space in an all-electron calculation. In ultrasoft pseudopotentials, this requirement is relaxed and charge augmentation functions are used to make up the difference. As its name implies, this allows a "softer" pseudopotential to be generated, which means fewer planewaves are required to expand it.

The pseudopotentials are not unique, and calculated properties depend on them. However, there are standard methods for ensuring the quality and transferability (to different chemical environments) of the pseudopotentials cite:PhysRevB.56.15629.

** Fermi Temperature and band occupation numbers
At absolute zero, the occupancies of the bands of a system are well-defined step functions; all bands up to the Fermi level are occupied, and all bands above the Fermi level are unoccupied.  There is a particular difficulty in the calculation of the electronic structures of metals compared to semiconductors and molecules. In molecules and semiconductors, there is a clear energy gap between the occupied states and unoccupied states. Thus, the occupancies are insensitive to changes in the energy that occur during the self-consistency cycles. In metals, however, the density of states is continuous at the Fermi level, and there are typically a substantial number of states that are close in energy to the Fermi level.  Consequently, small changes in the energy can dramatically change the occupation numbers, resulting in instabilities that make it difficult to converge to the occupation step function. A related problem is that the Brillouin zone integral (which in practice is performed as a sum over a finite number of $\mathbf{k}$ points) that defines the band energy converges very slowly with the number of $\mathbf{k}$ points due to the discontinuity in occupancies in a continuous distribution of states for metals cite:gillan1989:calcul,Kresse199615.  The difficulty arises because the temperature in most DFT calculations is at absolute zero.  At higher temperatures, the DOS is smeared across the Fermi level, resulting in a continuous occupation function over the distribution of states. A finite-temperature version of DFT was developed cite:PhysRev.137.A1441, which is the foundation on which one solution to this problem is based. In this solution, the step function is replaced by a smoothly varying function such as the Fermi-Dirac function at a small, but non-zero temperature cite:Kresse199615. The total energy is then extrapolated back to absolute zero.

** Spin polarization and magnetism
There are two final points that need to be discussed about these calculations, spin polarization and dipole corrections. Spin polarization is important for systems that contain net spin. For example, iron, cobalt and nickel are magnetic because they have more electrons with spin "up" than spin "down" (or vice versa).  Spin polarization must also be considered in atoms and molecules with unpaired electrons, such as hydrogen and oxygen atoms, oxygen molecules and radicals. For example, there are two spin configurations for an oxygen molecule, the singlet state with no unpaired electrons, and the triplet state with two unpaired electrons. The oxygen triplet state is lower in energy than the oxygen singlet state, and thus it corresponds to the ground state for an oxygen atom. A classically known problem involving spin polarization is the dissociation of a hydrogen molecule. In this case, the molecule starts with no net spin, but it dissociates into two atoms, each of which has an unpaired electron.  See section 5.3.5 in Reference citealp:koch2001 for more details on this.


In VASP, spin polarization is not considered by default; it must be turned on, and an initial guess for the magnetic moment of each atom in the unit cell must be provided (typically about one Bohr-magneton per unpaired electron). For Fe, Co, and Ni, the experimental values are 2.22, 1.72, and 0.61 Bohr-magnetons, respectively cite:kittel and are usually good initial guesses. See Reference citealp:PhysRevB.56.15629 for a very thorough discussion of the determination of the magnetic properties of these metals with DFT. For a hydrogen atom, an initial guess of 1.0 Bohr-magnetons (corresponding to one unpaired electron) is usually good. An oxygen atom has two unpaired electrons, thus an initial guess of 2.0 Bohr-magnetons should be used.  The spin-polarized solution is sensitive to the initial guess, and typically converges to the closest solution. Thus, a magnetic initial guess usually must be provided to get a magnetic solution.  Finally, unless an adsorbate is on a magnetic metal surface, spin polarization typically does not need to be considered, although the gas-phase reference state calculation may need to be done with spin-polarization.

The downside of including spin polarization is that it essentially doubles the calculation time.

In this chapter we consider how to construct models of molecules, how to manipulate them, and how to calculate many properties of molecules. For a nice comparison of VASP and Gaussian see citealp:paier:234102.
** Defining and visualizing molecules
We start by learning how to define a molecule and visualize it. We will begin with defining molecules from scratch, then reading molecules from data files, and finally using some built-in databases in =ase=.
*** From scratch
When there is no data file for the molecule you want, or no database to get it from, you have to define your atoms geometry by hand. Here is how that is done for a CO molecule (Figure ref:fig:co-origin). We must define the type and position of each atom, and the unit cell the atoms are in.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase import Atoms, Atom
from ase.io import write

# define an Atoms object
atoms = Atoms([Atom('C', [0., 0., 0.]),
               Atom('O', [1.1, 0., 0.])],
              cell=(10, 10, 10))

print('V = {0:1.0f} Angstrom^3'.format(atoms.get_volume()))

write('images/simple-cubic-cell.png', atoms, show_unit_cell=2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: V = 1000 Angstrom^3

#+caption: Image of a CO molecule with the C at the origin. \label{fig:co-origin}
#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :width 2in
#+attr_org: :width 200
[[./images/simple-cubic-cell.png]]

There are two inconvenient features of the simple cubic cell:

1. Since the CO molecule is at the corner, its electron density is spread over the 8 corners of the box, which is not convenient for visualization later (see [[*Visualizing%20electron%20density][Visualizing electron density]]).

2. Due to the geometry of the cube, you need fairly large cubes to make sure the electron density of the molecule does not overlap with that of its images. Electron-electron interactions are repulsive, and the overlap makes the energy increase significantly. Here, the CO molecule has 6 images due to periodic boundary conditions that are 10 \AA away. The volume of the unit cell is 1000 \AA$^3$.

The first problem is easily solved by centering the atoms in the unit cell. The second problem can be solved by using a face-centered cubic lattice, which is the lattice with the closest packing. We show the results of the centering in Figure ref:fig:co-fcc, where we have guessed values for $b$ until the CO molecules are on average 10 \AA apart. Note the final volume is only about 715 \AA$^3$, which is smaller than the cube. This will result in less computational time to compute properties.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase import Atoms, Atom
from ase.io import write

b = 7.1
atoms = Atoms([Atom('C', [0., 0., 0.]),
               Atom('O', [1.1, 0., 0.])],

                    [b, 0., b],
                    [0., b, b]])

print('V = {0:1.0f} Ang^3'.format(atoms.get_volume()))

atoms.center()  # translate atoms to center of unit cell

At this point you might ask, "How do you know the distance to the neighboring image?" The =ag= viewer lets you compute this graphically, but we can use code to determine this too. All we have to do is figure out the length of each lattice vector, because these are what separate the atoms in the images. We use the mod:numpy module to compute the distance of a vector as the square root of the sum of squared elements.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase import Atoms, Atom
import numpy as np

b = 7.1
atoms = Atoms([Atom('C', [0., 0., 0.]),
               Atom('O', [1.1, 0., 0.])],
              cell=[[b, b, 0.],
                    [b, 0., b],
                    [0., b, b]])

# get unit cell vectors and their lengths
(a1, a2, a3) = atoms.get_cell()

#+end_example

You can read XYZ file format to create mod:ase.Atoms objects.  Here is
what an XYZ file format might look like:

#+begin_example
#+include: molecules/isobutane.xyz
#+end_example

The first line is the number of atoms in the file. The second line is
often a comment. What follows is one line per atom with the symbol and
Cartesian coordinates in \AA. Note that the XYZ format does not have
unit cell information in it, so you will have to figure out a way to
provide it. In this example, we center the atoms in a box with vacuum
on all sides (Figure ref:fig:isobutane).

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.io import read, write

atoms = read('molecules/isobutane.xyz')
atoms.center(vacuum=5)
write('images/isobutane-xyz.png', atoms, show_unit_cell=2)
#+END_SRC

*** Predefined molecules

mod:ase defines a number of molecular geometries in the
mod:ase.data.molecules database.  For example, the database includes
the molecules in the G2/97 database cite:curtiss:1063. This database
contains a broad set of atoms and molecules for which good
experimental data exists, making them useful for benchmarking studies.
See [[http://www.cse.anl.gov/OldCHMwebsiteContent/compmat/comptherm.htm][this site]] for the original files.

The coordinates for the atoms in the database are [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B8ller-Plesset_perturbation_theory][MP2]](full)/[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_set_%28chemistry%29][6-31G(d)]]
optimized geometries. Here is a list of all the species available in
mod:ase.data.g2. You may be interested in reading about some of the other databases in mod:ase.data too.

<<g2-database>>
Some other databases include the mod:ase.data.s22 for weakly interacting dimers and complexes, and mod:ase.data.extra_molecules which has a few extras like biphenyl and C60.

Here is an example of getting the geometry of an acetonitrile molecule and writing an image to a file. Note that the default unit cell is a 1 Å × Å × Å  cubic cell. That is too small to use if your calculator uses periodic boundary conditions. We center the atoms in the unit cell and add vacuum on each side. We will add 6 Å of vacuum on each side. In the write command we use the option =show_unit_cell= =2 to draw the unit cell boundaries. See Figure ref:fig:ch3cn.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

It is possible to rotate the atoms with func:ase.io.write if you wanted to see pictures from another angle. In the next example we rotate 45 degrees about the $x$-axis, then 45 degrees about the $y$-axis. Note that this only affects the image, not the actual coordinates. See Figure ref:fig:ch3cn-rot.

If you actually want to rotate the coordinates, there is a nice way to do that too, with the func:ase.Atoms.rotate method. Actually there are some subtleties in rotation. One rotates the molecule an angle (in radians) around a vector, but you have to choose whether the center of mass should be fixed or not. You also must decide whether or not the unit cell should be rotated. In the next example you can see the coordinates have changed due to the rotations. Note that the write function uses the rotation angle in degrees, while the rotate function uses radians.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.structure import molecule
from ase.io import write
from numpy import pi

atoms = molecule('CH3CN')
atoms.center(vacuum=6)
p1 = atoms.get_positions()

atoms.rotate('x', pi/4, center='COM', rotate_cell=False)
atoms.rotate('y', pi/4, center='COM', rotate_cell=False)

Note in this last case the unit cell is oriented differently than the previous example, since we chose not to rotate the unit cell.

*** Combining Atoms objects
It is frequently useful to combine two =Atoms= objects, e.g. for computing reaction barriers, or other types of interactions. In =ase=, we simply add two =Atoms= objects together. Here is an example of getting an ammonia and oxygen molecule in the same unit cell. See Figure ref:fig:combined-atoms. We set the =Atoms= about three \AA apart using the func:ase.Atoms.translate function.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.structure import molecule
from ase.io import write

atoms1 = molecule('NH3')

atoms2 = molecule('O2')
atoms2.translate([3, 0, 0])

bothatoms = atoms1 + atoms2
bothatoms.center(5)

write('images/bothatoms.png', bothatoms, show_unit_cell=2, rotation='90x')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :width 2in
#+attr_org: :width 200
[[./images/bothatoms.png]]

** Simple properties
Simple properties do not require a DFT calculation. They are typically only functions of the atom types and geometries.
*** Getting cartesian positions
If you want the $(x,y,z)$ coordinates of the atoms, use the func:ase.Atoms.get_positions. If you are interested in the fractional coordinates, use func:ase.Atoms.get_scaled_positions.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.structure import molecule

# access properties on each atom
print(' #  sym   p_x     p_y     p_z')

*** Molecular weight and molecular formula
[[index:molecular weight]]
We can quickly compute the molecular weight of a molecule with this recipe. We use func:ase.Atoms.get_masses to get an array of the atomic masses of each atom in the =Atoms= object, and then just sum them up.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.structure import molecule

atoms = molecule('C6H6')
masses = atoms.get_masses()

molecular_weight = masses.sum()
molecular_formula = atoms.get_chemical_formula(mode='reduce')

# note use of two lines to keep length of line reasonable
s = 'The molecular weight of {0} is {1:1.2f} gm/mol'
print(s.format(molecular_formula, molecular_weight))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The molecular weight of C6H6 is 78.11 gm/mol

Note that the argument =reduce=True= for func:ase.Atoms.get_chemical_formula collects all the symbols to provide a molecular formula.

*** Center of mass
[[index:center of mass]]
The center of mass (COM) is defined as:

COM = $\frac{\sum m_i \cdot r_i}{\sum m_i}$

The center of mass is essentially the average position of the atoms, weighted by the mass of each atom. Here is an example of getting the center of mass from an =Atoms= object using func:ase.Atoms.get_center_of_mass.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.structure import molecule
import numpy as np

*** Moments of inertia
[[index:moment of inertia]]
The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia][moment of inertia]] is a measure of resistance to changes in rotation. It is defined by $I = \sum_{i=1}^N m_i r_i^2$ where $r_i$ is the distance to an axis of rotation. There are typically three moments of inertia, although some may be zero depending on symmetry, and others may be degenerate. There is a convenient function to get the  moments of inertia: func:ase.Atoms.get_moments_of_inertia. Here are several examples of molecules with different types of symmetry.:

#+BEGIN_SRC python

If you want to know the principle axes of rotation, we simply pass =vectors=True= to the function, and it returns the moments of inertia and the principle axes.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.structure import molecule

atoms = molecule('CH3Cl')
moments, axes = atoms.get_moments_of_inertia(vectors=True)
print('Moments = {0}'.format(moments))
print('axes = {0}'.format(axes))

: axes = [[ 0.  0.  1.]
:  [ 0.  1.  0.]
:  [ 1.  0.  0.]]

This shows the first moment is about the z-axis, the second moment is about the y-axis, and the third moment is about the x-axis.

*** Computing bond lengths and angles
A typical question we might ask is, "What is the structure of a molecule?" In other words, what are the bond lengths, angles between bonds, and similar properties. The Atoms object contains an func:ase.Atoms.get_distance method to make this easy. To calculate the distance between two atoms, you have to specify their indices, remembering that the index starts at 0.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.structure import molecule

# ammonia
atoms = molecule('NH3')

print('atom symbol')
print('===========')
for i, atom in enumerate(atoms):
    print('{0:2d} {1:3s}' .format(i, atom.symbol))

# N-H bond length
s = 'The N-H distance is {0:1.3f} angstroms'
print(s.format(atoms.get_distance(0, 1)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: atom symbol
: ===========
:  0 N
:  1 H
:  2 H
:  3 H
: The N-H distance is 1.017 angstroms

Bond angles are a little trickier. If we had vectors describing the directions between two atoms, we could use some simple trigonometry to compute the angle between the vectors: $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = |\vec{a}||\vec{b}| \cos(\theta)$.  So we can calculate the angle as $\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{|\vec{a}||\vec{b}|}\right)$, we just have to define our two vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. We compute these vectors as the difference in positions of two atoms. For example, here we compute the angle H-N-H in an ammonia molecule. This is the angle between N-H$_1$ and N-H$_2$. In the next example, we utilize functions in mod:numpy to perform the calculations, specifically the func:numpy.arccos function, the func:numpy.dot function, and func:numpy.linalg.norm functions.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.structure import molecule

# ammonia
atoms = molecule('NH3')

print('atom symbol')

for i, atom in enumerate(atoms):
    print('{0:2d} {1:3s}'.format(i, atom.symbol))

a = atoms.positions[0] - atoms.positions[1]
b = atoms.positions[0] - atoms.positions[2]

from numpy import arccos, dot, pi
from numpy.linalg import norm

theta_rad = arccos(dot(a, b) / (norm(a) * norm(b)))  # in radians

print('theta = {0:1.1f} degrees'.format(theta_rad * 180./pi))
#+END_SRC

Alternatively you could use func:ase.Atoms.get_angle. Note we want the angle between atoms with indices [1, 0, 2] to get the H-N-H angle.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

**** Dihedral angles
There is support in ase for computing [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_angle][dihedral angles]]. Let us illustrate that for ethane. We will compute the dihedral angle between atoms 5, 1, 0, and 4. That is a H-C-C-H dihedral angle, and one can visually see (although not here) that these atoms have a dihedral angle of 60^{\circ} (Figure ref:fig:ethane-dihedral).

In this section we covered properties that require simple calculations, but not DFT calculations, to compute.

   :END:
There are many properties that only require a single DFT calculation to obtain the energy, forces, density of states, electron density and electrostatic potential. This section describes some of these calculations and their analysis.
*** Energy and forces
Two of the most important quantities we are interested in are the total
energy and the forces on the atoms. To get these quantities, we have
to define a calculator and attach it to an mod:ase.Atoms object so
that =ase= knows how to get the data. After defining the calculator a
DFT calculation must be run.

Here is an example of getting the energy and forces from a CO
molecule. The forces in this case are very high, indicating that this
geometry is not close to the ground state geometry. Note that the
forces are only along the $x$-axis, which is along the molecular axis. We will see how to minimize this force in [[*Manual%20determination%20of%20a%20bond%20length][Manual determination]] and [[*Automatic%20geometry%20optimization%20with%20VASP][Automatic geometry optimization with VASP]].

**** Convergence with unit cell size
There are a number of parameters that affect the energy and forces including the calculation parameters and the unit cell. We will first consider the effect of the unit cell on the total energy and forces. The reason that the unit cell affects the total energy is that it can change the distribution of electrons in the molecule.

Here there are evidently attractive interactions between the CO molecules which lower the total energy for small box sizes. We have to decide what an appropriate volume for our calculation is, and the choice depends on the goal. We may wish to know the total energy of a molecule that is not interacting with any other molecules, e.g. in the ideal gas limit. In that case we need a large unit cell so the electron density from the molecule does not go outside the unit cell where it would overlap with neighboring images.

It pays to check for convergence. The cost of running the calculation goes up steeply with increasing cell size. Doubling a lattice vector here leads to a 20-fold increase in computational time! Note that doubling a lattice vector length increases the volume by a factor of 8 for a cube. The cost goes up because the number of planewaves that fit in the cube grows as the cube gets larger.

Let us consider what the pressure in the unit cell is. In the ideal gas limit we have $PV = nRT$, which gives a pressure of zero at absolute zero. At non-zero temperatures, we have $P=n/V RT$. Let us consider some examples. In atomic units we use $k_B$ instead of $R$.

You can see in this figure that it takes a cutoff energy of about 400 eV to achieve a convergence level around 10 meV, and that even at 500 meV the energy is still changing slightly. Keep in mind that we are generally interested in differences in total energy, and the differences tend to converge faster than a single total energy. Also it is important to note that it is usually a single element that determines the rate of convergence. The reason we do not just use very high ENCUT all the time is it is expensive.

*** Visualizing electron density

The electron density is a 3\(d\) quantity: for every $(x,y,z)$ point, there is a charge density. That means we need 4 numbers for each point: $(x,y,z)$ and $\rho(x,y,z)$. Below we show an example (Figure ref:fig:cd1) of plotting the charge density, and we consider some issues we have to consider when visualizing volumetric data in unit cells with periodic boundary conditions. We will use the results from a previous calculation.

*** Dipole moments
[[index:dipole moment]]
The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dipole_moment#Molecular_dipoles][dipole moment]] is a vector describing the separation of  electrical (negative) and nuclear (positive) charge. The magnitude of this vector is the dipole moment, which has units of Coulomb-meter, or more commonly Debye. The symmetry of a molecule determines if a molecule has a dipole moment or not. Below we compute the dipole moment of CO. We must integrate the electron density to find the center of electrical charge, and compute a sum over the nuclei to find the center of positive charge.

*** The density of states (DOS)

*** Atom-projected density of states on molecules
Let us consider which states in the density of states belong to which atoms in a molecule. This can only be a qualitative consideration because the orbitals on the atoms often hybridize to form molecular orbitals, e.g. in methane the $s$ and $p$ orbitals can form what we call $sp^3$ orbitals. We can compute atom-projected density of states in VASP, which is done by projecting the wave function onto localized atomic orbitals. Here is an example. We will consider the CO molecule. To get atom-projected density of states, we must set [[incar:RWIGS][RWIGS]] for each atom. This parameter defines the radius of the sphere around the atom which cuts off the projection. The total density of states and projected density of states information comes from the DOSCAR file.

Note that unlike the DOS, here we must run another calculation because we did not specify the atom-projected keywords above. Our strategy is to get the atoms from the previous calculation, and use them in a new calculation. You could redo the calculation in the same directory, but you risk losing the results of the first step. That can make it difficult to reproduce a result. We advocate our approach of using multiple directories for the subsequent calculations, because it leaves a clear trail of how the work was done.

#+begin_note
The [[incar:RWIGS][RWIGS]] is not uniquely determined for an element. There are various natural choices, e.g. the ionic radius of an atom, or a value that minimizes overlap of neighboring spheres, but these values can change slightly in different environments.

You can also get spin-polarized atom-projected DOS, and magnetization projected DOS. See http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/vasp/DOSCAR_file.html#doscar for more details.

need to read wavecar files! We cannot do this yet. There is some hope at http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/feenstra/wavetrans/, but I have not figured out how to use it yet.

*** Bader analysis
index:bader

Note: Thanks to @prtkm for helping improve this section (https://github.com/jkitchin/dft-book/issues/2).
Bader analysis is a charge partitioning scheme where charge is divided by surfaces of zero flux that define atomic basins of charge. The most modern way of calculating the Bader charges is using the =bader= program from Graeme Henkelmen's group cite:Henkelman2006354,doi.10.1021/ct100125x. Let us consider a water molecule, centered in a box. The strategy is first to run the calculation, then run the bader program on the results.

We have to specify laechg to be true so that the all-electron core charges will be written out to files. Here we setup and run the calculation to get the densities first.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from vasp import Vasp

from ase.structure import molecule
atoms = molecule('H2O')
atoms.center(vacuum=6)

calc = Vasp('molecules/h2o-bader',
            xc='PBE',
            encut=350,
            lcharg=True,
            laechg=True,
            atoms=atoms)
print calc.potential_energy
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: -14.22250648

Now that the calculation is done, get the bader code and scripts from http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/code/bader/.

We use this code to see the changes in charges on the atoms.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from vasp import Vasp

calc = Vasp('molecules/h2o-bader')
calc.bader(ref=True, overwrite=True)
atoms = calc.get_atoms()
for atom in atoms:
    print('|{0} | {1} |'.format(atom.symbol, atom.charge))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: |O | -1.2326 |
: |H | 0.6161 |
: |H | 0.6165 |



The results above are comparable to those from gpaw at https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/tutorials/bader/bader.html.

You can see some charge has been "transferred" from H to O.

*** Manual determination of a bond length
The equilibrium bond length of a CO molecule is approximately the bond length that minimizes the total energy. We can find that by computing the total energy as a function of bond length, and noting where the minimum is. Here is an example in VASP. There are a few features to point out here. We want to compute 5 bond lengths, and each calculation is independent of all the others. mod:vasp is set up to automatically handle jobs for you by submitting them to the queue. It raises a variety of exceptions to let you know what has happened, and you must handle these to control the workflow. We will illustrate this by the following examples.

*** Automatic geometry optimization with VASP
It is generally the case that the equilibrium geometry of a system is the one that minimizes the total energy and forces. Since each atom has three degrees of freedom, you can quickly get a high dimensional optimization problem. Luckily, VASP has built-in geometry optimization using the [[incar:IBRION][IBRION]] and [[incar:NSW][NSW]] tags. Here we compute the bond length for a CO molecule, letting VASP do the geometry optimization for us.

Here are the most common choices for IBRION.
| IBRION value | algorithm                                      |
|--------------+------------------------------------------------|
|            1 | quasi-Newton    (use if initial guess is good) |
|            2 | conjugate gradient                             |


#+begin_note
VASP applies a criteria for stopping a geometry optimization. When the change in energy between two steps is less than 0.001 eV (or 10*EDIFF), the relaxation is stopped. This criteria is controlled by the incar:EDIFFG tag. If you prefer to stop based on forces, set EDIFFG=-0.05, i.e. to a negative number. The units of force is eV/\AA. For most work, a force tolerance of 0.05 eV/\AA is usually sufficient.

*** Manual calculation of vibrational frequency

The principle idea in calculating vibrational frequencies is that we consider a molecular system as masses connected by springs. If the springs are Hookean, e.g. the force is proportional to the displacement, then we can readily solve the equations of motion and find that the vibrational frequencies are related to the force constants and the masses of the atoms. For example, in a simple molecule like CO where there is only one spring, the frequency is:

$\nu = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{k/\mu}$ where $\frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{m_C} + \frac{1}{m_O}$ and $k$ is the spring constant. We will compute the value of $k$ from DFT calculations as follows:

$k = \frac{\partial^2E}{\partial x^2}$ at the equilibrium bond length. We actually already have the data to do this from [[*Manual%20determination%20of%20a%20bond%20length][Manual determination]]. We only need to fit an equation to the energy vs. bond-length data, find the minimum energy bond-length, and then evaluate the second derivative of the fitted function at the minimum. We will use a cubic polynomial for demonstration here. Polynomials are numerically convenient because they are easy to fit, and it is trivial to get the roots and derivatives of the polynomials, as well as to evaluate them at other points using func:numpy.polyfit, func:numpy.polyder, and func:numpy.polyval.

This result is in good agreement with [[http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C630080&Units=SI&Type=IR-SPEC&Index=0#IR-SPEC][experiment]]. The procedure described above is basically how many vibrational calculations are performed. With more atoms, you have to determine a force constant matrix and diagonalize it. For more details, see cite:wilson1955. In practice, we usually allow a packaged code to automate this, which we cover in [[*Automated%20vibrational%20calculations][Automated vibrational calculations]].

We now consider how much energy is in this vibration. This is commonly called zero-point energy (ZPE) and it is defined as $E_{ZPE} = \frac{1}{2} h \nu$ for a single mode, and $h$ is Planck's constant (4.135667516e-15 eV/s).

#+BEGIN_SRC python

c = 3e10  # speed of light cm/s
h = 4.135667516e-15  # eV*s

nu = 2143.6076625*c  # 1/s

E_zpe = 0.5*h*nu

print('E_ZPE = {0:1.3f} eV'.format(E_zpe))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: E_ZPE = 0.133 eV

This is a reasonable amount of energy! Zero-point energy increases with increasing vibrational frequency, and tends to be very important for small atoms.

A final note is that this analysis is in the "harmonic approximation". The frequency equation is the solution to a harmonic oscillator. If the spring is non-linear, then there are anharmonic effects that may become important, especially at higher temperatures.

*** TODO Automated vibrational calculations
VASP has built-in capability for performing vibrational calculations. We access the capability by using a new value for incar:IBRION. The values of 5 and 6 calculated the Hessian matrix using finite differences. For IBRION=5, all atoms that are not constrained are displaced. For IBRION=6, only symmetry inequivalent displacements are considered, which makes the calculations slightly cheaper. You can specify the number of displacements with incar:NFREE. The default number of displacements is 2. You can also specify the size of the displacement with incar:POTIM (the default is 0.015 \AA).

Note we get 9 frequencies here. Water has 3 atoms, with three degrees of freedom each, leading to 9 possible combinations of collective motions. Three of those collective motions are translations, i.e. where all atoms move in the same direction (either $x$, $y$ or $z$) and there is no change in the total energy of the molecule. Another three of those motions are rotations, which also do not change the total energy of the molecule. That leaves 3N-6 = 3 degrees of vibrational freedom where some or all of the bonds are stretched, resulting in a change in the total energy. The modes of water vibration are (with our calculated values in parentheses):

1. a symmetric stretch at 3657 cm^{-1}   (3723)
2. an asymmetric stretch at 3756 cm^{-1} (3836)
3. and a bending mode at 1595 cm^{-1}    (1583)

http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C7732185&Mask=800#Electronic-Spec

The results are not too far off, and more accurate frequencies may be possible using tighter tolerance on [[incar:POTIM][POTIM]], or by using [[incar:IBRION][IBRION]]=7 or 8.

Let us briefly discuss how to determine which vectors are vibrations and which are rotations or translations. One way is to visualize the modes. The vibrations are easy to spot. The rotations/translations are not always cleanly separable. This is an issue of accuracy and convergence. We usually do not worry about this because these modes are usually not important.

1. mode 0 is an asymmetric stretch
2. mode 1 is a symmetric stretch
3. mode 2 is a bending mode
4. mode 3 is a mixed translation/rotation
5. mode 4 is a rotation
6. mode 5 is a translation
7. mode 6 is a rotation
8. mode 7 is a partial translation
9. mode 8 is a rotation

**** Zero-point energy for multiple modes
For a molecule with lots of vibrational modes the zero-point energy is defined as the sum over all the vibrational modes:

$E_{ZPE} = \sum_i \frac{1}{2} h \nu_i$

Here is an example for water. Note we do not sum over the imaginary modes. We should also ignore the rotational and translational modes (some of those are imaginary, but some are just small).

from vasp import Vasp

#+RESULTS:


Note the zero-point energy of water is also fairly high (more than 0.5 eV). That is because of the high frequency O-H stretches.

** Simulated infrared spectra

At http://homepage.univie.ac.at/david.karhanek/downloads.html#Entry02 there is a recipe for computing the Infrared vibrational spectroscopy intensities in VASP. We are going to do that for water here. First, we will relax a water molecule.

Next, we instruct VASP to compute the vibrational modes using [[http://cmt.dur.ac.uk/sjc/thesis_prt/node39.html][density functional perturbation theory]] with IBRION=7. Note, this is different than in [[Vibrational frequencies]] where finite differences were used.

The interpretation of these results is that the mode at 3713 cm^{-1} would be nearly invisible in the IR spectrum. Earlier we interpreted that as the symmetric stretch. In this mode, there is only a small change in the molecule dipole moment, so there is a small IR intensity.

** Thermochemical properties of molecules
index:thermochemistry
mod:ase.thermochemistry can be used to estimate thermodynamic properties of gases in the ideal gas limit. The module needs as input the geometry, the total energy, the vibrational energies, and some information about the molecular symmetry. We first consider an N_{2} molecule.

The symmetry numbers are determined by the molecular point group cite:springerlink-10.1007/s00214-007-0328-0. Here is a table of the most common ones.

*** O_{2} dissociation
The first reaction we consider is a simple dissociation of oxygen molecule into two oxygen atoms: O_{2} \rightarrow 2O. The dissociation energy is pretty straightforward to define: it is the energy of the products minus the energy of the reactant. $D = 2*E_O - E_{O_2}$. It would appear that we simply calculate the energy of an oxygen atom, and the energy of an oxygen molecule and evaluate the formula. Let us do that.

The answer we have obtained is way too high! Experimentally the dissociation energy is about 5.2 eV (need reference), which is *very* different than what we calculated! Let us consider some factors that contribute to this error.

We implicitly neglected spin-polarization in the example above. That could be a problem, since the O_{2} molecule can be in one of two spin states, a singlet or a triplet, and these should have different energies. Furthermore, the oxygen atom can be a singlet or a triplet, and these would have different energies. To account for spin polarization, we have to tell VASP to use spin-polarization, and give initial guesses for the magnetic moments of the atoms. Let us try again with spin polarization.

**** Estimating O_{2} dissociation energy with spin polarization in triplet ground states
To tell VASP to use spin-polarization we use [[incar:ISPIN][ISPIN]]=2, and we set initial guesses for magnetic moments on the atoms with the magmom keyword. In a triplet state there are two electrons with spins of the same sign.

This is much closer to accepted literature values for the DFT-GGA O$_2$ dissociation energy. It is still more than 1 eV above an experimental value, but most of that error is due to the GGA exchange correlation functional. Some additional parameters that might need to be checked for convergence are the SIGMA value (it is probably too high for a molecule), as well as the cutoff energy. Oxygen is a "hard" atom that requires a high cutoff energy to achieve high levels of convergence.

You can see in Figure ref:fig:o2-sp-dos that there are two different densities of states for the two spins. One has 7 electrons in it (the blue lines), and the other has 5 electrons in it (the green line). The difference of two electrons leads to the magnetic moment of 2 which we calculated earlier. Remember that only peaks in the DOS below the Fermi level are occupied. It is customary to set the Fermi level to 0 eV in DOS plots. The peaks roughly correspond to electrons. For example, the blue peak between -25 and -30 eV corresponds to one electron, in a 1s orbital, where as the blue peak between -5 and -10 eV corresponds to three electrons.

Based on these results (Figure ref:fig:o2-encut), you could argue the dissociation energy is converged to about 2 meV at a planewave cutoff of 450 eV, and within 50 meV at 350 eV cutoff. You have to decide what an appropriate level of convergence is. Note that increasing the planewave cutoff significantly increases the computational time, so you are balancing level of convergence with computational speed. It would appear that planewave cutoff is not the cause for the discrepancy between our calculations and literature values.

**** Illustration of the effect of SIGMA

The methodology for extrapolation of the total energy to absolute zero is
only valid for a continuous density of states at the Fermi level
cite:Kresse199615. Consequently, it should not be used for
semiconductors, molecules or atoms. In VASP, this means a very small
Fermi temperature (SIGMA) should be used.  The O_{2} dissociation energy
as a function of SIGMA is shown in Figure
ref:fig:sigma-o2-diss. A variation of nearly 0.2 eV is seen from the
default Fermi temperature of $k_bT=0.2$ eV and the value of
$k_bT=0.0001$ eV. However, virtually no change was observed for a
hydrogen atom or molecule or for an oxygen molecule as a function of
the Fermi temperature. It is recommended that the total energy be
calculated at several values of the Fermi temperature to make sure the
total energy is converged with respect to the Fermi temperature.

We were not careful in selecting a good value for [[incar:SIGMA][SIGMA]] in the calculations above. The default value of SIGMA is 0.2, which may be fine for metals, but it is not correct for molecules. SIGMA is the broadening factor used to smear the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. For a metal with a continuous density of states this is appropriate, but for molecules with discrete energy states it does not make sense. We are somewhat forced to use the machinery designed for metals on molecules. The solution is to use a very small SIGMA. Ideally you would use SIGMA=0, but that is not practical for convergence reasons, so we try to find what is small enough. Let us examine the effect of SIGMA on the dissociation energy here.

Interestingly, VASP still found a triplet spin state on the oxygen atom, even though we guessed an initial magnetic moment of 0. This highlights a difficulty in computing magnetic moments: you provide an initial guess and a solution is found. The magnetic moment of a singlet state is zero, so the  molecule is correct. Also interesting is that the dissociation energy is almost equal to the experimental value. This is probably a coincidence, and may reflect the fact that the singlet oxygen state is less stable than the triplet state. Let us directly compare their total energies:

You can see here the triplet state has an energy that is 1 eV more stable than the singlet state.

**** Estimating triplet oxygen dissociation energy with low symmetry
It has been suggested that breaking spherical symmetry of the atom can result in lower energy of the atom. The symmetry is broken by putting the atom off-center in a box. We will examine the total energy of an oxygen atom in a few geometries. First, let us consider variations of a square box.

: O2 -> 2O  D = 6.062 eV

This actually agrees within 30-50 meV of reported literature values, although still nearly an eV greater than the experimental dissociation energy. Note that with a different "random" position, we get the lower energy for the O atom. All the disagreement we had been seeing was apparently in the O atom energy. So, if you do not need the dissociation energy in your analysis, you will not see the error. Also note that this error is specific to there being a spherical atom in a symmetric cell. This is not a problem for most molecules, which are generally non-spherical.

**** Verifying the magnetic moments on each atom
It is one thing to see the total magnetic moment of a singlet state, and another to ask what are the magnetic moments on each atom. In VASP you must use incar:LORBIT = 11 to get the magnetic moments of the atoms written out.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from vasp import Vasp

calc = Vasp('molecules/O2-sp-singlet')
calc.clone('molecules/O2-sp-singlet-magmoms')


calc.set(lorbit=11)
atoms = calc.get_atoms()
magmoms = atoms.get_magnetic_moments()

print('singlet ground state')
for i, atom in enumerate(atoms):
    print('atom {0}: magmom = {1}'.format(i, magmoms[i]))
print(atoms.get_magnetic_moment())

calc = Vasp('molecules/O2-sp-triplet')
calc.clone('molecules/O2-sp-triplet-magmoms')

calc.set(lorbit=11)
atoms = calc.get_atoms()
magmoms = atoms.get_magnetic_moments()
print()
print('triplet ground state')
for i, atom in enumerate(atoms):
    print('atom {0}: magmom = {1}'.format(i, magmoms[i]))
print(atoms.get_magnetic_moment())
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: singlet ground state
: atom 0: magmom = 0.0
: atom 1: magmom = 0.0
: 0.0
: ()
: triplet ground state
: atom 0: magmom = 0.815
: atom 1: magmom = 0.815
: 2.0000083

Note the atomic magnetic moments do not add up to the total magnetic moment. The atomic magnetic moments are not really true observable properties. The moments are determined by a projection method that probably involves a spherical orbital, so the moments may be over or underestimated.

**** Using a different potential
It is possible we need a higher quality potential to get the 6.02 eV value quoted by many in the literature. Here we try the O_sv potential, which treats the 1s electrons as valence electrons. Note however, the ENMIN in the POTCAR is very high!

This result is close to other reported values. It is possibly not converged, since we let VASP choose the ENCUT value, and that value is the ENMIN value in the POTCAR. Nevertheless, the point is that a harder potential does not fix the problem of overbinding in the O_{2} molecule. That is a fundamental flaw in the GGA exchange-correlation functional.

*** Water gas shift example
We consider calculating the reaction energy of the water-gas shift reaction in this example.

CO + H_{2}O $\leftrightharpoons$ CO_{2} + H_{2}

We define the reaction energy as the difference in energy between the products and reactants.

$\Delta E = E_{CO_2} + E_{H_2} - E_{CO} - E_{H_2O}$

For now, we compute this energy simply as the difference in DFT energies. In the next section we will add zero-point energies and compute the energy difference as a function of temperature. For now, we simply need to compute the total energy of each molecule in its equilibrium geometry.

In the next section we will examine whether additional corrections are needed, such as zero-point and temperature corrections.

It is a good idea to verify your calculations and structures are what you expected. Let us print them here. Inspection of these results shows the geometries were all relaxed, i.e., the forces on each atom are less than 0.05 eV/\AA.

*** Temperature dependent water gas shift equilibrium constant
To correct the reaction energy for temperature effects, we must compute the vibrational frequencies of each species, and estimate the temperature dependent contributions to vibrational energy and entropy. We will break these calculations into several pieces. First we do each vibrational calculation. After those are done, we can get the data and construct the thermochemistry objects we need to estimate the reaction energy as a function of temperature (at constant pressure).

This is too negative compared to the experimental standard free energy, which we estimated to be about -29 kJ/mol from the [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/12/12/water-gas-shift-equilibria-via-the-nist-webbook/#7][NIST webbook. ]]There could be several reasons for this disagreement, but the most likely one is errors in the exchange-correlation functional. The error in energy has a significant effect on the calculated equilibrium constant, significantly overestimating it.

We will consider a simple example of the barrier for NH_{3} inversion. We have to create an NH_{3} molecule in the initial and inverted state (these have exactly the same energy), and then interpolate a band of images. Then, we use the NEB method cite:sheppard:134106 to compute the barrier to inversion. The NEB class of methods are pretty standard, but other algorithms for finding barriers (saddle-points) exist that may be relevant cite:olsen:9776.

** Defining and visualizing bulk systems
*** Built-in functions in ase
As with molecules, mod:ase provides several helper functions to create bulk structures. We highlight a few of them here. Particularly common ones are:

- mod:ase.lattice.cubic.FaceCenteredCubic
- mod:ase.lattice.cubic.BodyCenteredCubic
- mod:ase.lattice.hexagonal.Graphite
- mod:ase.lattice.compounds.NaCl

For others, see https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/lattice.html

We start with a simple example, fcc Ag. By default, mod:ase knows Ag is an fcc metal, and knows the experimental lattice constant. We have to specify the directions (vectors along each axis) to get something other than the default output. Here, the default fcc cell contains four atoms.

** Computational parameters that are important for bulk structures
*** k-point convergence
In the section on molecules, we learned that the total energy is a function of the planewave cutoff energy (ENCUT) used. In bulk systems that is true also. There is also another calculation parameter you must consider, the k-point grid. The k-point grid is a computational tool used to approximate integrals of some property, e.g. the electron density, over the entire unit cell. The integration is performed in reciprocal space (i.e. in the Brillouin zone) for convenience and efficiency, and the k-point grid is where the property is sampled for the integration. The higher the number of sampled points, the more accurately the integrals are approximated.

We will typically use a Monkhorst-Pack cite:PhysRevB.13.5188 $k$-point grid, which is essentially a uniformly spaced grid in the Brillouin zone. Another less commonly used scheme is the Chadi-Cohen k-point grid cite:PhysRevB.8.5747. The Monkhorst-Pack grids are specified as $n1 \times n2 \times n3$ grids, and the total number of k-points is $n1 \cdot n2 \cdot n3$. The computational cost is linear in the total number of k-points, so  a calculation on a $4 \times 4 \times 4$ grid will be roughly 8 times more expensive than on a $2 \times 2 \times 2$ grid. Hence, one seeks again to balance convergence with computational tractability. Below we consider the k-point convergence of fcc Ag.

Based on this figure, we need at least a $6 \times 6 \times 6$ k-point grid to achieve a convergence level of at least 50 meV. Note: the k-point convergence is not always monotonic like it is in this example, and sometimes very dense grids (e.g. up to $20 \times 20 \times 20$) are needed for highly converged properties such as the density of states in smaller unit cells. Oscillations in the total energy are typical, and it can be difficult to get high levels of convergence. The best practices are to use the same k-point sampling grid in energy differences where possible, and dense (high numbers of k-points) otherwise. It is important to check for convergence in these cases.

As unit cells get larger, the number of k-points required becomes smaller. For example, if a $1 \times 1 \times 1$ fcc unit cell shows converged energies in a $12 \times 12 \times 12$ k-point grid, then a $2 \times 2 \times 2$ fcc unit cell would show the same level of convergence with a $6 \times 6 \times 6$ k-point grid. In other words, doubling the unit cell vectors results in a halving of the number of k-points.

Sometimes you may see k-points described as k-points per reciprocal atom. For example, a $12 \times 12 \times 12$ k-point grid for a primitive fcc unit cell would be 1728 k-points per reciprocal atom. A $2 \times 2 \times 2$ fcc unit cell has eight atoms in it, or 0.125 reciprocal atoms, so a $6 \times 6 \times 6$ k-point grid has 216 k-points in it, or 216/0.125 = 1728 k-points per reciprocal atom, the same as we discussed before.

In the k-point convergence example above, we used a $6 \times 6 \times 6$ k-point grid on a unit cell with four atoms in it, leading to 864 k-points per reciprocal atom. If we had instead used the primitive unit cell, we would need either a $9 \times 9 \times 9$ or $10 \times 10 \times 10$ k-point grid to get a similar level of accuracy. In this case, there is no exact matching of k-point grids due to the difference in shape of the cells.

*** TODO Effect of [[incar:SIGMA][SIGMA]]
index:ISMEAR
index:SIGMA

In the self-consistent cycle  of a DFT calculation, the total energy is minimized with respect to occupation of the Kohn-Sham orbitals. At absolute zero, a band is either occupied or empty. This discrete occupation results in discontinuous changes in energy with changes in occupation, which makes it difficult to converge. One solution is to artificially broaden the band occupancies, as if they were occupied at a higher temperature where partial occupation is possible. This results in a continuous dependence of energy on the partial occupancy, and dramatically increases the rate of convergence. [[incar:SIGMA][SIGMA]] and [[incar:ISMEAR][ISMEAR]] affect how the partial occupancies of the bands are determined.

Some rules to keep in mind:
1. The smearing methods were designed for metals. For molecules, semiconductors and insulators you should use a very small SIGMA (e.g. 0.01).
2. Standard values for metallic systems is SIGMA=0.1, but the best SIGMA may be [[http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/guide/node159.html][material specific]].

The consequence of this finite temperature is that additional bands
must be included in the calculation to allow for the partially
occupied states above the Fermi level; the number of extra bands depends on
the temperature used.  An example of the maximum occupancies of the
bands for an Cu bulk as a function of SIGMA is
shown in Figure ref:fig:sigma-occ. Obviously, as SIGMA
approaches 0, the occupancy approaches a step function.  It is preferable
that the occupancy of several of the highest bands be zero (or at
least of order $1\times 10^{-8}$) to ensure enough variational freedom was
available in the calculation.  Consequently, it is suggested that fifteen to
twenty extra bands be used for a SIGMA of 0.20. In any case,
it should be determined that enough bands were used by examination of
the occupancies.  It is undesirable to have too many extra bands, as
this will add computational time.


Below we show the effect of SIGMA on the band occupancies.

*** The number of bands
In the last figure, it is evident that due to the smearing of the electronic states you need to have extra bands to accommodate the electrons above the Fermi level, and the higher the incar:SIGMA value is, the more bands you need. You need enough bands so that the highest energy bands are unoccupied, and VASP will give you a warning that looks like this:

#+end_example

We tell VASP the number of bands to use with the incar:NBANDS keyword. VASP will set the NBANDS automatically if you do not provide a value, but this is in general bad practice (even though it is often done in this book!). There are a few general guidelines for setting NBANDS. First we recognize that a band can only have two electrons in it (one spin up, and one spin down) in an calculation without spin-polarization, or one electron per band for a spin-polarized calculation (note that spin-polarization doubles the number of bands).  There absolutely must be enough bands to accommodate all the electrons, so the minimum number of bands is int(ceil(nelectrons/2)).

Here is an example of what this equation does.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

print int(np.ceil(50 / 2.))
print int(np.ceil(51 / 2.))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 25
: 26

However, due to the smearing, the minimum number of bands is almost never enough, and we always add more bands. The default behavior in VASP is:

| non-spin polarized | NELECT/2 + NIONS/2    |
| spin-polarized     | 0.6*NELECT + NMAGIONS |

These do not always work, especially for small molecular systems where NIONS/2 may be only 1, or transition metals where it may be necessary to add up to 2*NIONS extra bands.

To figure out how many bands you need, it is necessary to know how many electrons are in your calculation. The func:Vasp.get_valence_electrons provides this for you. Alternatively, you can look in the [[*Recommended%20values%20for%20ENCUT%20and%20valence%20electrons%20for%20different%20POTCAR%20files][Appendix]] for a table listing the number of valence electrons for each POTCAR file. Armed with this information you can set NBANDS the way you want.

For this calculation we need at least 6 bands (11/2=5.5 which is rounded up to 6) and we need to include some extra bands. The default rule would only add half a band, which is not enough. We add three additional bands. This system is so small it does not substantially increase the computational cost.

If you are too trifling to do that much work, you can use the func:Vasp.set_nbands to automatically set the number of bands. This function takes an argument =N= to set the number of bands to N, *or* an argument =f= to set the NBANDS according to the formula $nbands = int(nelectrons/2 + len(atoms)*f)$. The default value of =f= is 1.5. If you want the default VASP behavior, set f=0.5. For transition metals, it may be required that f=2. This function does not consider whether the calculation is spin-polarized or not. Here is an example of using func:Vasp.set_nbands.

You are, of course, free to use any formula you want to set the number of bands. Some formulas I have used in the past include:

1. NBANDS = 0.65*NELECT + 10
2. NBANDS = 0.5*NELECT + 15
3. etc...

** Determining bulk structures
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       82305f4d-66ec-4971-9504-fd44ff75bb6e
   :END:
What we typically mean by determining bulk structures includes the following:

- What is the most stable crystal structure for a material?
- What is the lattice constant of fcc Cu?
- What are the lattice parameters and internal atom parameters for TiO_{2}?

All of these questions can often be addressed by finding the volume, shape and atomic positions that minimize the total energy of a bulk system. This is true at 0K. At higher temperatures, one must consider minimizing the free energy, rather than the internal energy.

*** fcc/bcc crystal structures

The fcc and bcc structures are simple. They only have one degree of freedom: the lattice constant. In this section we show how to calculate the equilibrium volume of each structure, and determine which one is more stable. We start with the fcc crystal structure of Cu. We will manually define the crystal structure based on the definitions in Kittel cite:kittel (Chapter 1).

Before we jump into the bcc calculations, let us consider what range of lattice constants we should choose. The fcc lattice is close-packed, and the volume of the primitive cell is $V = 1/4 a^3$ or about 11.8 \AA^{3}/atom. The volume of the equilibrium bcc primitive cell will probably be similar to that. The question is: what bcc lattice constant gives that volume? The simplest way to answer this is to compute the answer. We will make a bcc crystal at the fcc lattice constant, and then compute the scaling factor needed to make it the right volume.

[[./images/Cu-bcc-fcc.png]]

Note we plot the energy vs. atomic volume. That is because the lattice constants of the two crystal structures are very different. It also shows that the atomic volumes in the two structures are similar.

What can we say here? The fcc structure has a lower energy than the bcc structure, so we can conclude the fcc structure is more favorable. In fact, the fcc structure is the experimentally found structure for Cu. Some caution is in order; if you run these calculations at a $4 \times 4 \times 4$ $k$-point grid, the bcc structure is more stable because the results are not converged!

#+begin_exercise
Compute the energy vs. volume for fcc and bcc Cu for different $k$-point grids. Determine when each result has converged, and which structure is more stable.
#+end_exercise

What can we say about the relative stability of fcc to hcp? Nothing, until we calculate the hcp equation of state.


*** Optimizing the hcp lattice constant
The hcp lattice is more complicated than the fcc/bcc lattices because there are two lattice parameters: $a$ and $c$ or equivalently: $a$ and $c/a$. We will start by making a grid of values and find the set of parameters that minimizes the energy. See Figure ref:fig:ru-e-ca.

*** Complex structures with internal degrees of freedom
A unit cell has six degrees of freedom: the lengths of each unit cell vector, and the angle between each vector. There may additionally be internal degrees of freedom for the atoms. It is impractical to try the approach used for the hcp Ru on anything complicated. Instead, we rely again on algorithms to optimize the unit cell shape, volume and internal degrees of freedom. It is usually not efficient to make a wild guess of the geometry and then turn VASP loose on to optimize it. Instead, the following algorithm works pretty well.

1. Find the volume (at constant shape, with relaxed ions) that minimizes the total energy ([[incar:ISIF][ISIF]]=2). The goal here is to just get an idea of where the right volume is.
2. Using the results from step 1 as a starting point, perform a set of calculations at constant volume around the minimum from step 1, but the shape and internal atom positions are allowed to change ([[incar:ISIF][ISIF]]=4).
3. Finally, do a final calculation near the minimum energy allowing the volume to also change. ([[incar:ISIF][ISIF]]=3).

This multistep process is pretty reasonable to get a converged structure pretty quickly. It is not foolproof, however, and if you have materials such as graphite it may not work well. The problem with graphite is that it is a layered compound that is held together by weak van der waal type forces which are not modeled well by typical GGA functionals. Thus the change in energy due to a volume change is larger in the plane of the graphite sheet than in the direction normal to the sheet. With a typical GGA, the sheets may just move apart until they do not interact any more.

We will illustrate the process on a well-behaved system (rutile TiO_{2}) which has two lattice parameters and one internal degree of freedom. There are a few subtle points to mention in doing these calculations. The VASP [[http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/guide/node161.html][manual]] recommends that you set incar:PREC to 'high', and that ENCUT be set to 1.3*max(ENMAX) of the pseudopotentials. This is necessary to avoid problems caused by small basis sets when the volume changes, and Pulay stress. It is important to ensure that the energies are reasonably converged with respect to k-point grids. Hence, it can be a significant amount of work to do this right! Let us start with determining the ENCUT value that is appropriate for TiO_{2}.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
grep ENMAX $VASP_PP_PATH/potpaw_PBE/Ti/POTCAR
grep ENMAX $VASP_PP_PATH/potpaw_PBE/O/POTCAR

#+RESULTS:
:    ENMAX  =  178.330; ENMIN  =  133.747 eV
:    ENMAX  =  400.000; ENMIN  =  300.000 eV

According to the manual, we should use ENCUT = 1.3*400 = 520 eV for good results.

Now we consider the k-point convergence. The lattice vectors of the rutile TiO_{2} structure are not all the same length, which means it is not essential that we use the same number of k-points in each direction. For simplicity, however, we do that here.

Now, we know the minimum energy volume is near 64 \AA^3. You could at this point fit an equation of state to find that minimum. However, we now want to use these initial starting points for a second round of optimization where we allow the unit cell shape to change, at constant volume: ISIF=4.

The take away message here is that the total energy slightly decreases when we allow the unit cell shape to change, especially for the larger unit cell deformation. This has little effect on the minimum volume, but would have an effect on the bulk modulus, which is related to the curvature of the equation of state. At this point, you could fit an equation of state to the step 2 data, and estimate the volume at the minimum volume, and recalculate the total energy at that volume.

An alternative is a final calculation with ISIF=3, which optimizes the unit cell volume, shape and internal coordinates.  It looks like the calculation at bulk/tio2/step2-1.05 is close to the minimum, so we will use that as a starting point for the final calculation.

This is the final result. You can see that the forces on all the atoms are less than 0.01 eV/\AA, and the stress is also very small. The final volume is close to where we expect it to be based on steps 1 and 2. The space group is still correct. The lattice vectors are close in length to the experimentally known values, and the angles between the vectors has not changed much. Looks good!

As a final note, the VASP [[http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/guide/node164.html][manual]] recommends you do not use the final energy directly from the calculation, but rather run a final calculation with incar:ISMEAR set to -5. Here we examine the effect.

The difference here is on the order of a meV. That does not seem significant here. I suspect the recommended practice stems from early days when much smaller ENCUT values were used and changes in the number of basis functions were more significant.

*** Effect of XC on bulk properties
The exchange correlation functional can significantly affect computed bulk properties. Here, we examine the effect on the bulk lattice constant of Pd (exp. 3.881). An excellent review of this can be found in cite:mattsson-084714. We examine several functionals. The =xc= keyword in =Vasp= is used to select the POTCARs.  Let us consider the LDA functional first.

These results compare very favorably to those in cite:mattsson-084714. It is typical that LDA functionals underestimate the lattice constants, and that GGAs tend to overestimate the lattice constants. PBEsol and AM05 were designed specifically for solids, and for Pd, these functionals do an exceptional job of reproducing the lattice constants. RPBE is particularly bad at the lattice constant, but it has been reported to be a superior functional for reactivity cite:hammer1999:improv-pbe.

According to Kittel cite:kittel, the cohesive energy of Rh is 5.75 eV. There are a few reasons we may have discrepancy here:

1. The k-point grid used in the bulk state is not very dense. However, you can see below that the total energy is pretty converged by a $6 \times 6 \times 6$ $k$-point grid.
2. We did not check for convergence with the planewave cutoff.
3. We neglected spin on the atomic state. Rh in the atomic state has this electronic structure:   [Kr] 4d8 5s1 and is a doublet.

First we consider the k-point convergence.

Using only 1 k-point for the bulk energy is a terrible approximation! It takes at least a 6 \times 6 \times 6 grid to get the total energy converged to less than 10 meV. Note we do not need to check the k-point convergence of the atomic state because it is surrounded by vacuum on all sides, and so there should not be any dispersion in the bands.

We will examine the magnetic state next.

Again, the value in Kittel cite:kittel is 5.75 eV which is very close to this value. Finally, it is also possible there is a lower energy non-spherical atom energy; we did not check that at all (see [[*Estimating%20triplet%20oxygen%20dissociation%20energy%20with%20low%20symmetry][Estimating triplet oxygen dissociation energy with low symmetry]]).

** Elastic properties
See this reference cite:PhysRevB.65.104104.

We seek the elastic constant tensor that relates stress (\sigma) and strain (\epsilon) via \(\sigma = c \epsilon \). The stress and strain are six component vectors, so $c$ will be a 6 \times 6 symmetric matrix.

Fe is in a BCC crystal structure, which is high in symmetry. Consequently, many of the elements in the matrix are equal to zero.

This example shows the basic mechanics of getting the elastic constants. The C_{44} constant above is too low, and probably we need to check these constants for convergence with respect to kpoints, planewave cutoff, and maybe the value of POTIM.

** Bulk thermodynamics
We can predict temperature dependent thermodynamic properties of bulk materials without too much effort. As with the thermochemical properties of ideal gases, we must use some simple models that we parameterize by DFT. Here we follow the example in Reference citealp:Shang20101040 for computing the thermal coefficient of expansion, heat capacity, enthalpy and entropy for Ni as a function of temperature.

We start by computing the equation of state for fcc Ni.

** Effect of pressure on phase stability
So far we have only considered relative stability at a pressure of 0 Pa. We now consider the relative stability of two phases under pressure. We will consider TiO$_2$ in the rutile and anatase phases.

The pressure is defined by: $P = -\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial V}\right)_T$. So if we have an equation of state $E(V)$ we can calculate the pressure at any volume, or alternatively, given a pressure, compute the volume. Pressure can affect the energy of two phases differently, so that one may become stable under pressure. The condition where a phase transition occurs is when the pressure in the two phases is the same, which occurs at a common tangent.

To show this, we need $E_{rutile}(V)$ and $E_{anatase}(V)$.

To find the conditions where a phase transition occurs, we have to find the common tangent line between the rutile and anatase phases. In other words we have to solve these two equations:

$(E_{anatase}(V1) - E_{rutile}(V2))/(V1-V2) = P_{anatase}(V1)$

$(E_{anatase}(V1) - E_{rutile}(V2))/(V1-V2) = P_{rutile}(V2)$

This is a nonlinear algebra problem. We use the func:scipy.optimize.fsolve to solve this problem.

*** Alloy formation energies
In this section we will consider how to calculate the formation energy of an fcc Cu-Pd alloy and how to use that information to discuss relative stabilities. The kinds of questions we can easily answer are:

1. Is the formation of an alloy at a particular composition and structure energetically favorable?
2. Given two alloy structures at the same composition, which one is more stable?
3. Given a set of alloy structures at different compositions, which ones are stable with respect to phase separation?

Each of these questions is answered by calculating the formation energy of the alloy from the parent metals. Thus, we will need the total energies of fcc Cu and fcc Pd. To get started. We get those first. Rather than compute a full equation of state for these, we will rely on the built in unit cell optimization algorithm in VASP (ISIF=3).

Note that the Pd energy is more negative than the Cu energy. This does not mean anything significant. We cannot say Pd is more stable than Cu; it is not like Cu could transmutate into Pd!

Next, we will consider a question like which of two structures with composition of CuPd is more stable. These coordinates for these structures came from research of the author. The approach is pretty general, you must identify the coordinates and unit cell of the candidate structure, and then run a calculation to find the optimized geometry and unit cell. This may take some work, as previously described in the multistep process for optimizing a bulk system. Here the geometry is pretty close to optimized, so we can use the VASP optimization routines. We consider two structures with composition CuPd.

Looking at these energies, you could be tempted to say cupd-2 is more stable than cupd-1 because its energy is much lower. This is wrong, however, because cupd-2 has twice as many atoms as cupd-1. We should compare the normalized total energies, that is the energy normalized per CuPd formula unit, or as an alternative  the number of atoms in the unit cell. It does not matter which, as long as we normalize consistently. It is conventional in alloy calculation to normalize by the number of atoms in the unit cell.

After normalizing by number of atoms, we can see that cupd-1 is a more stable structure. However, we are looking at total energies, and we might ask: is cupd-1 more stable than an unreacted mixture of the parent compounds, fcc Cu and Pd? In other words, is the following reaction exothermic:

Cu + Pd $\rightarrow$ CuPd for the two configurations we examined? Below, we show some pretty general code that computes these formation energies, and normalizes them by the number of atoms in the unit cell.

The answer is yes. Both structures are energetically more favorable than an equal composition mixture of the parent metals. The heat of formation for both structures is exothermic, but the cupd-1 structure is more stable than the cupd-2 structure. This is shown conceptually in Figure ref:fig:alloy1.

The formation energy is slightly exothermic, which means the structure is more stable than a mixture of the parent metals. However, let us consider whether the structure is stable with respect to phase separation into pure Cu and the cupd-1 structure. We define the following quantities:

$H_{f,Cu}$ = 0.0 eV/atom,    $x_0$ = 0,
$H_{f,cupd-1}$ = -0.12 eV/atom,   $x_3$ = 0.5.

The composition weighted average at $x_{Pd}=0.25$ is:

$H_f = H_{f,Cu} + \frac{x0-x}{x0-x3}(H_{f,cupd-1} - H_{f,Cu})$

We find the weighted composition formation energy of pure Cu and cupd-1 is more favorable than the formation energy of cu3pd-1. Therefore, we could expect that structure to phase separate into a mixture of pure Cu and cupd-1. Schematically what we are seeing is shown in Figure \ref:fig:alloy-phase-separation.

This looks promising: the formation energy is much more favorable than cu3pd-1, and it is below the composition weighted formation energy of -0.06 eV/atom. Consequently, we conclude that this structure will not phase separate into a mixture of Cu and CuPd. We cannot say, however, if there is a more stable phase not yet considered, or if it might phase separate into two other phases. We also note here that we have ignored a few other contributions to alloy stability. We have only considered the electronic energy contributions to the formation energy. At temperatures above absolute zero there are additional contributions including configurational and vibrational entropy, which may stabilize some structures more than others. Finally, our analysis is limited to comparisons of the structures computed on the fcc lattice. In fact, it is known that the CuPd alloy forms a bcc structure. We did not calculate that structure, so we can not say if it is more or less stable than the obvious fcc structure we found.

The construction of alloy phase diagrams is difficult. You are always faced with the possibility that there is a phase that you have not calculated that is more stable than the ones you did calculate. One approach is to use a tool that automates the discovery of relevant structures such as the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit ([[http://www.its.caltech.edu/~avdw/atat/][ATAT]]) cite:vandeWalle2002539,vandeWalle2009266 which uses a cluster expansion methodology.

This is the reaction energy for 2 Cu_{2}O $\rightarrow$ 4 CuO. In cite:PhysRevB.73.195107, the experimental reaction is estimated to be  about -3.14 eV.

There are a few reasons why our number does not agree with the experimental reaction energy. One reason is related to errors in the O_{2} dissociation energy, and another reason is related to localization of electrons in the Cu 3\(d\) orbitals cite:PhysRevB.73.195107. The first error of incorrect O_{2} dissociation error is a systematic error that can be corrected empirically cite:PhysRevB.73.195107. Fixing the second error requires the application of DFT+U (see [[*DFT%2BU][DFT+U]]).

The heat of reaction is reported to be 1000 J/g product at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/er.4440130107/pdf for the reaction 2CuO $\rightleftharpoons$ Cu_{2}O + 1/2 O_{2}.

** Bulk density of states
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       cdf40b4f-f686-48b4-a458-c885f62b8bbf
   :END:
The density of states refers to the number of electronic states in a particular energy range.

The solution to Eq. eqref:eq:KS yields a set of Kohn-Sham (K-S) orbitals and an
associated set of eigenvalues that correspond to the energies of these
orbitals, neither of which have any known directly observable meaning
cite:RevModPhys.71.1253.  The sum of the squared K-S orbitals,
however, is equal to the electron density (Eq. \eqref{eq:density}),
and the sum of the eigenvalues is a significant part of the total
energy (Eq.  \eqref{eq:dftEnergy}). Thus, it seems reasonable to
suppose these quantities have other significant relationships to
physical observables. Perdew et al. showed that the highest occupied
eigenvalue is equal to the ionization energy of a system within an
exact density functional theory cite:perdew1982:elect-kohn-sham, but
their interpretation has been vigorously debated in the literature
cite:kleinman1997:signif-kohn-sham,perdew1997,kleinman1997:reply-commen-kohn-sham,
and is only true for the exact exchange/correlation functional, not
the approximate ones used in practice cite:koch2001.
Stowasser and Hoffmann discussed an approach to using the K-S orbitals
in more traditional molecular orbital interpretations, but the results
were primarily qualitative cite:stowasser1999:what-kohn-sham. More
recently, a DFT analog of Koopmans' theorem has been developed that
formally identifies the eigenvalues with vertical ionization
potentials, which can be measured with photoelectron spectroscopy
cite:gritsenko2002.

Despite the arguments against ascribing physical meaning to the K-S
orbitals and eigenvalues, it has become fairly standard, especially
for solids, to use them to calculate the density of states (DOS)
cite:jones1989 [Sec.  VI.  B].  This has been found to yield
reasonable results for the valence bands in metals, but poor results
for tightly bound orbitals and band gaps
cite:perdew1982:elect-kohn-sham. A highly technical discussion of
this issue can be found in Ref. citealp:perdew1981:self.  The
density of states can be calculated by a sum over the k-points
cite:seitsonen2000:phd:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dos}
\Rho(\epsilon)=\sum_\mathbf{\mathrm{k}} \omega_\mathbf{\mathrm{k}} \sum_i \beta(\epsilon -\epsilon_{i\mathbf{\mathrm{k}}})
\end{equation}

where $\omega_\mathbf{\mathrm{k}}$ is the weight associated with the
k-point, and $\beta$ is a broadening function, typically a gaussian
function, to account for the finite number of k-points used in the
calculations. The amount of broadening is arbitrary, and should tend
to zero as the number of k-points approaches infinity.

** Atom projected density of states
One major disadvantage of a planewave basis set is that it is difficult to relate the completely delocalized planewaves to localized phenomena such as bonding. Much insight into bonding has been gained by atomic/molecular orbital theory, which has carried over to the solid-state arena cite:RevModPhys.60.601. Consequently, several schemes have been developed to project the one-electron Kohn-Sham wave functions onto atomic wave functions cite:sanchez-portal1995:projec,segall1996:popul,segall1996:popul-mp.  In VASP, the one electron wave functions can be projected onto spherical harmonic orbitals. The radial component of the atomic orbitals extends to infinity. In a solid, this means that the projection on one atom may overlap with the projection on a neighboring atom, resulting in double counting of electrons.  Consequently, a cutoff radius was introduced, beyond which no contributions are included.  It is not obvious what the best cutoff radius is. If the radius is too small, it might not capture all of the electrons associated with the atom. However, if it is too large, it may include electrons from neighboring atoms.  One might want to use different cutoff radii for different atoms, which have different sizes.  Furthermore, the ideal cutoff radius for an atom may change in different environments, thus it would require an iterative procedure to determine it.  This difficulty arises because the orbital-band occupations are not observable, thus how the electrons are divided up between atoms is arbitrary and, as will be seen later, is sensitive to the cutoff radius (and in other DFT implementations, the basis set).  However, Mulliken orbital populations have been used successfully for many years to examine the qualitative differences between similar systems, and that is precisely what these quantities are used for here.  Thus, a discussion of the analysis and results is warranted.

The s and p states in a metal are typically delocalized in space and more like free-electrons, whereas the d-orbitals are fairly localized in space and have been treated successfully with tight-binding theories such as extended H\"u ckel theory cite:RevModPhys.60.601, and linear muffin tin orbital theory cite:ruban1997:surfac.  Consequently, the remaining discussion will be focused on the properties of the projected d-states.

In this example, we consider how to get the atom-projected density of states (ADOS). We are interested in properties of the $d$-band on Pd, such as the $d$-band center and $d$-band width. You must set the [[incar:RWIGS][RWIGS]] tag to get ADOS, and these are the Wigner-Seitz radii for each atom.  By integrating the projected d-band up to the Fermi level, the d-band filling can be determined.  It is not obvious what the electron count in the d-band should be for an atom in a metal.  For a gas-phase, neutral metal atom in the ground state, however, the d-orbital electron count is well defined, so it will be used as an initial reference point for comparison cite:kittel.

A powerful method for characterizing distributions is to examine various moments of the distribution (see Chapter 4 in Ref.  citealp:cottrell1988 and Chapter 6 in Refs. citealp:ducastelle1991 and citealp:pettifor1992:elect-theor-alloy-desig). The $n^{th}$ order moment, $\mu_n$, of a distribution of states $\rho(\epsilon)$ with respect to a reference $\epsilon_o$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
\mu_n = \frac{\int_{-\infty}^\infty \epsilon^n \rho(\epsilon-\epsilon_o)d\epsilon}
{\int_{-\infty}^\infty \rho(\epsilon-\epsilon_o)d\epsilon}
\end{equation}
In this work, the reference energy is always the Fermi level.  The zeroth moment is just the total number of states, in this case it will be normalized to unity. The first moment is the average energy of distribution, analogous to the center of mass for a mass density distribution. The second moment is the mean squared width of the distribution. The third moment is a measure of skewness and the fourth moment is related to kurtosis, but these moments are rarely used, and only the first and second moments are considered in this work.

It is important to note that these projected density of states are not physical observables. They are the wavefunctions projected onto atomic orbitals. For some situations this makes sense, e.g. the $d$ orbitals are fairly localized and reasonably approximated by atomic orbitals. The $s$ valence orbitals in a metal, in contrast, are almost totally delocalized. Depending on the cutoff radius (RWIGS) you choose, you can see very different ADOS.

The d-band center and width also change.

** Band structures
[[index:band structure]]
To compute a band structure we do two things. First, we compute the self-consistent band structure. Then we compute the band structure at the desired $k$-points. We will use Si as an example (adapted from http://bbs.sciencenet.cn/bbs/upload/20083418325986.pdf).

First, we get the self-consistent electron density in a calculation.

Now, we run a new calculation along the k-point path desired. The standard VASP way of doing this is to modify the INCAR and KPOINTS file and rerun VASP. We will not do that. Doing that results in some lost information if you overwrite the old files. We will copy the old directory to a new directory, using code to ensure this only happens one time.

*** create example showing band dispersion with change in lattice constant

In this section, we examine the effect of the lattice constant on the band structure. Since the lattice constant affects the overlap of neighboring atoms, we expect that smaller lattice constants will show more dispersion, i.e. broader bands. Larger lattice constants, in contrast, should show narrower bands. We examine this in silicon.

*** Determining if a magnetic solution is energetically favorable
We can force a total magnetic moment onto a unit cell and compute the total energy as function of the total magnetic moment. If there is a minimum in the energy, then we know there is a lower energy magnetic solution than a non-magnetic solution. We use incar:NUPDOWN to enforce the magnetic moment in the cell. Note that NUPDOWN can only be an integer. You cannot set it to be an arbitrary float.

You can see here there is a minimum in energy at a total magnetic moment somewhere between 4 and 5. There are two Fe atoms in the unit cell, which means the magnetic moment on each atom must be about 2.5 Bohr-magnetons. This is a good guess for a real calculation. Note that VASP [[http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/guide/node100.html#SECTION00099000000000000000][recommends]] you overestimate the magnetic moment guesses if you are looking for ferromagnetic solutions.

To run a spin-polarized calculation with initial guesses on each atom, we must set the magnetic moment on the atoms. Here we set it through the =magmom= attribute on the atom. In the example after this, we set it in the =Atoms= object.

*** Antiferromagnetic spin states
In an antiferromagnetic material, there are equal numbers of spin up and down electrons that align in a regular pattern, but pointing in opposite directions so that there is no net magnetism. It is possible to model this by setting the magnetic moments on each mod:ase.Atom object. incar:lreal

You can see that even though the total magnetic moment is 0, there is a spin on both Fe atoms, and they are pointing in opposite directions. Hence, the sum of spins is zero, and this arrangement is called anti-ferromagnetic.

** Surface structures
As with molecules and bulk systems mod:ase provides several convenience functions for making surfaces.
*** Simple surfaces
ase provides many [[https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/surface.html#module-ase.lattice.surface][utility functions]] to setup surfaces. Here is a simple example of an fcc111 Al surface. There are built in functions for fcc111, bcc110, bcc111, hcp001 and diamond111.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.lattice.surface import fcc111
from ase.io import write
from ase.visualize import view

slab = fcc111('Al', size=(2, 2, 3), vacuum=10.0)
from ase.constraints import FixAtoms
constraint = FixAtoms(mask=[atom.tag >= 2 for atom in slab])
slab.set_constraint(constraint)

#+RESULTS:

#+ATTR_LaTeX: :width 205bp :placement [H]
#+caption: An Al(111) slab with three layers and 20 \AA of vacuum.

*** Vicinal surfaces

The vast majority of surface calculations are performed on flat surfaces. This is partially because these surfaces tend to have the lowest surface energies, and thus are likely to be experimentally observed. The flat surfaces, also known as low Miller index surfaces, also have small unit cells, which tends to make them computationally affordable. There are, however, many reasons to model the properties of surfaces that are not flat. You may be interested in the reactivity of a step edge, for example, or you may use the lower cooridnation of steps as a proxy for nanoparticle reactivity.  Many stepped surfaces are not that difficult to make now. The main idea in generating them is described [[https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/_downloads/general_surface.pdf][here]]. mod:ase provides a general function for making vicinal surfaces. Here is an example of a (211) surface.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

from ase.io import write

# Au(211) with 9 layers
s1 = surface('Au', (2, 1, 1), 9)
s1.center(vacuum=10, axis=2)

write('images/Au-211.png',
      s1.repeat((3, 3, 1)),
      rotation='-30z,90x',  # change the orientation for viewing

** Surface calculation parameters
There is one important parameter that is different for surfaces than for bulk calculations, the k-point grid. Assuming you have followed the convention that the z-axis is normal to the surface, the k-point grids for slab calculations always have the form of $M \times N \times 1$. To illustrate why, consider this example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python

slab = fcc111('Al', size=(1, 1, 4), vacuum=10.0)

            lwave=True,   # and wavecar for the restart
            atoms=slab)

n, bands, p = calc.get_bandstructure(kpts_path=[(r'$\Gamma$', [0, 0, 0]),
                                                ('$K1$', [0.5, 0.0, 0.0]),

Some points to note. The forces on the atoms have symmetry to them. That is because the slab is centered. Had the slab had an odd number of atoms, it is likely the center atom would have no forces on it. Next we consider the spacing between each layer in the slab. We do this for comparison later.

To reduce the forces, we can let VASP relax the geometry. We have to make some decisions about how to relax the slab. One choice would be to relax all the atoms in the slab. If we do that, then there will be no atoms with bulk like spacing unless we increase the slab thickness pretty dramatically. It is pretty common to freeze some atoms at the bulk coordinates, and let the others relax. We will freeze the bottom two layers (defined by tags 3 and 4) and let the first two layers relax. To do that we add constraints to the slab.

Note: the [[https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/constraints.html][ase constraints]] are only partially used by =Vasp=. The mod:ase.constraints.FixAtoms constraint gets written to the POSCAR file, and is then used internally in VASP. The only other constraint that VASP can use internally is [[mod:ase.constraints.FixScaled]]. The other constraints are not written to the POSCAR and are not used by VASP.

You can see that atoms 2 and 3 (the ones we relaxed, because the have tags of 1 and 2, which are less than 3) now have very low forces on them and it appears that atoms 0 and 1 have no forces on them. That is because the FixAtoms constraint works by setting the forces on those atoms to zero. We can see in the next example that the z-positions of the relaxed atoms have indeed relaxed and changed, while the position of the frozen atoms did not change.

Note there are two versions of the forces. The true forces, and the forces when constraints are applied.

#+RESULTS:

Depending on the layer there is either slight contraction or expansion. These quantities are small, and careful convergence studies should be performed. Note the total energy change from unrelaxed to relaxed is not that large in this case (e.g., it is about 5 meV). This is usually the case for metals, where the relaxation effects are relatively small. In oxides and semiconductors, the effects can be large, and when there are adsorbates, the effects can be large also.

** Surface reconstruction
index:reconstruction

We previously considered how relaxation can lower the surface energy. For some surfaces, a more extreme effect can reduce the surface energy: reconstruction. In a simple surface relaxation, the basic structure of a surface is preserved. However, sometimes there is a different surface structure that may have a lower surface energy. Some famous reconstructions include: Si-\(\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{7}\), Pt(100) hex reconstruction cite:PhysRevB.56.10518,PhysRevB.82.161418, and the Au(111) herringbone reconstruction.

We will consider the (110) missing row reconstruction cite:PhysRevB.83.075415. For some metals, especially Pt and Au, it is energetically favorable to form the so-called missing row reconstruction where every other row in the surface is "missing". It is favorable because it lowers the surface energy. Let us consider how we might calculate and predict that. It is straightforward to compute the energy of a (110) slab, and of a (110) slab with one row missing. However, these slabs contain different numbers of atoms, so we cannot directly compare the total energies to determine which energy is lower.

We have to consider where the missing row atoms have gone, so we can account for their energy. We will consider that they have gone into the bulk, and so we to consider the energy associated with the following transformation:

slab_{110} $\rightarrow$ slab_{missing row} + bulk

Thus, if this change in energy: \(E_{bulk} + E_{slab_{missing row}} - E_{slab_{110}} \) is negative, then the formation of the missing row is expected to be favorable.

*** Au(110) missing row reconstruction
We first consider the Au(110) case, where the reconstruction is known to be favorable.

The missing row formation energy is slightly negative. The magnitude of the formation energy is pretty small, but just slightly bigger than the typical convergence errors observed, so we should cautiously conclude that the reconstruction if favorable for Au(110). We made a lot of shortcuts in computing this quantity, including using the experimental lattice constant of Au, not checking for convergence in k-points or planewave cutoff, and not checking for convergence with respect to slab thickness or number of relaxed layers.

For Ag(110), the missing row formation energy is practically thermoneutral, i.e. not that favorable. This energy is so close to 0eV, that we cannot confidently say whether the reconstruction is favorable or not.

It is questionable whether we should consider this evidence of a missing row reconstruction because the number is small. That does not mean the reconstruction will not happen, but it could mean it is very easy to lift.

** Surface energy
The easiest way to calculate surface energies is from this equation:

$\sigma = \frac{1}{2}(E_{slab} - \frac{N_{slab}}{N_{bulk}} E_{bulk})$

where $E_{slab}$ is the total energy of a symmetric slab (i.e. one with inversion symmetry, and where both sides of the slab have been relaxed), $E_{bulk}$ is the total energy of a bulk unit cell, $N_{slab}$ is the number of atoms in the slab, and $N_{bulk}$ is the number of atoms in the bulk unit cell. One should be sure that the bulk energy is fully converged with respect to $k$-points, and that the slab energy is also converged with respect to $k$-points. The energies should be compared at the same cutoff energies. The idea is then to increase the thickness of the slab until the surface energy $\sigma$ converges.

#+caption: Schematic figure illustrating the calculation of a surface energy.
[[./images/surface-construction.png]]

Unfortunately, this approach does not always work. The bulk system is treated subtly different than the slab system, particularly in the $z$-direction where the vacuum is (where typically only one $k$-point is used in slabs). Consequently, the $k$-point sampling is not equivalent in the two systems, and one can in general expect some errors due to this, with the best case being cancellation of the errors due to total $k$-point convergence. In the worst case, one can get a linear divergence in the surface energy with slab thickness cite:PhysRevB.49.16798.

A variation of this method that usually results in better $k$-point error cancellation is to calculate the bulk unit cell energy using the slab unit cell with no vacuum space, with the same $k$-point mesh in the $x$ and $y$ directions, but with increased $k$-points in the $z$-direction. Thus, the bulk system and slab system have the same Brillouin zone in at least two dimensions. This maximizes the cancellation of $k$-point errors, but still does not guarantee convergence of the surface energy, as discussed in cite:PhysRevB.49.16798,0953-8984-10-4-017.

For quick estimates of the surface energy, one of the methods described above is likely sufficient. The advantage of these methods is the small number of calculations required to obtain the estimate, one needs only a bulk calculation (which must be done anyhow to get the bulk lattice constant to create the slab), and a slab calculation that is sufficiently thick to get the estimate. Additional calculations are only required to test the convergence of the surface energy.

An alternative method for calculating surface energies that does not involve an explicit bulk calculation follows Ref. cite:0953-8984-10-4-017. The method follows from equation (ref{eq:se}) where for a N-atom slab, in the limit of N \rightarrow \infty,

$E_{slab} \approx 2\sigma + \frac{N_{slab}}{N_{bulk}} E_{bulk}$

Then, we can estimate E_{bulk} by plotting the total energy of the slab as a function of the slab thickness.

$\sigma = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{2}(E_{slab}^N - N \Delta E_N)$

where $\Delta E_N = E_{slab}^N - E_{slab}^{N-1}$.

We will examine this approach here. We will use unrelaxed slabs for computational efficiency.

** Dipole correction
[[index:dipole correction]]

A subtle problem can arise when an adsorbate is placed on one side of
a slab with periodic boundary conditions, which is currently the
common practice.  The problem is that this gives the slab a dipole
moment. The array of dipole moments created by the periodic boundary
conditions generates an electric field that can distort the electron
density of the slab and change the energy. The existence of this field
in the vacuum also makes the zero-potential in the vacuum ill-defined,
thus the work function is not well-defined. One solution to this
problem is to use slabs with adsorbates on both sides, but then very
thick (eight to ten layers) slabs must be used to ensure the
adsorbates do not interact through the slab. An alternative solution,
the dipole correction scheme, was developed by Neugebauer and
Scheffler cite:PhysRevB.46.16067 and later corrected by Bengtsson
cite:PhysRevB.59.12301. In this technique, an external field is
imposed in the vacuum region that exactly cancels the artificial field
caused by the slab dipole moment. The advantage of this approach is
that thinner slabs with adsorbates on only one side can be used.

There are also literature reports that the correction is small
cite:morikawa2001:c2h2-si.  Nevertheless, in the literature the use
of this correction is fairly standard, and it is typical to at least
consider the correction.

Here we will just illustrate the effect.

*** TODO Slab with a dipole correction
    Note this takes a considerably longer time to run than without a dipole correction! In VASP there are several levels of dipole correction to apply. You can use the [[incar:IDIPOL][IDIPOL]] tag to turn it on, and specify which direction to apply it in (1=$x$, 2=$y$, 3=$z$, 4=$(x,y,z)$). This simply corrects the total energy and forces. It does not change the contents of LOCPOT. For that, you have to also set the [[incar:LDIPOL][LDIPOL]] and [[incar:DIPOL][DIPOL]] tags. It is not efficient to set all three at the same time for some reason. The VASP manual recommends you first set IDIPOL to get a converged electronic structure, and then set LDIPOL to True, and set the center of electron density in DIPOL. That makes these calculations a multistep process, because we must run a calculation, analyze the charge density to get the center of charge, and then run a second calculation.

The key points to notice in this figure are:
1. The two deep dips are where the atoms are.
2. Without a dipole correction, the electrostatic potential never flattens out. there is near constant slope in the vacuum region, which means there is an electric field there.
3. With a dipole correction the potential is flat in the vacuum region, except for the step jump near 23 \AA.
4. The difference between the Fermi level and the flat vacuum potential is the work function.
5. The difference in energy with and without the dipole correction here is small.

** Adsorption energies
[[index:adsorption energy]]
*** Simple estimate of the adsorption energy
Calculating an adsorption energy amounts to computing the energy of the following kind of reaction:

slab + gas-phase molecule $\rightarrow$ slab_adsorbate + products

#+attr_latex: :placement [H] :width 3in
#+attr_org: :width 300
#+caption: Schematic of an adsorption process.
[[./images/adsorbate-energy.png]]

There are many variations of this idea. The slab may already have some adsorbates on it, the slab may reconstruct on adsorption, the gas-phase molecule may or may not dissociate, and the products may or may not stick to the surface. We have to decide where to put the adsorbates, i.e. what site to put them on, and some sites will be more stable than others. We will consider the dissociative adsorption of O$_2$ on three sites of a Pt(111) slab. We will assume the oxygen molecule has split in half, and that the atoms have moved far apart. We will model the oxygen coverage at 0.25 ML, which means we need to use a $2 \times 2$ surface unit cell. For computational speed, we will freeze the slab, but allow the adsorbate to relax.

You can see the problem. We should not call the adsorption energy from this calculation a bridge site adsorption energy because the O atom is actually in an fcc site! This kind of result can happen with relaxation, and you should always check that the result you get makes sense. Next, we consider how to get a bridge site adsorption energy by using constraints.

Some final notes:
1. We did not let the slabs relax in these examples, and allowing them to relax is likely to have a big effect on the adsorption energies. You have to decide how many layers to relax, and check for convergence with respect to the number of layers.
2. The slabs were pretty thin. It is typical these days to see slabs that are 4-5 or more layers thick.
3. We did not consider how well converged the calculations were with respect to $k$-points or incar:ENCUT.
4. We did not consider the effect of the error in O$_2$ dissociation energy on the adsorption energies.
4. We did not consider coverage effects (see [[*Coverage%20dependence][Coverage dependence]]).

**** Adsorption on bridge site with constraints
To prevent the oxygen atom from sliding down into the fcc site, we have to constrain it so that it only moves in the $z$-direction. This is an artificial constraint; the bridge site is only metastable. But there are lots of reasons you might want to do this anyway. One is the bridge site is a transition state for diffusion between the fcc and hcp sites. Another is to understand the role of coordination in the adsorption energies. We use a func:ase.constraints.FixScaled constraint in ase to constrain the O atom so it can only move in the $z$-direction (actually so it can only move in the direction of the third unit cell vector, which only has a $z$-component).

You can see that only the \(z\)-position of the O atom changed. Also, the adsorption energy of O on the bridge site is *much* less favorable than on the fcc or hcp sites.

*** Coverage dependence
    The adsorbates on the surface can interact with each other which results in coverage dependent adsorption energies cite:PhysRevB.82.045414. Coverage dependence is not difficult to model; we simply compute adsorption energies in different size unit cells, and/or with different adsorbate configurations. Here we consider dissociative oxygen adsorption at 1ML on Pt(111) in an fcc site, which is one oxygen atom in a $1 \times 1$ unit cell.

*** Effect of adsorption on the surface energy
There is a small point to make here about what adsorption does to surface energies. Let us define a general surface formation energy scheme like this:

#+ATTR_LaTeX: :placement [H] :width 3in
#+ATTR_org: :width 300
#+caption: Schematic of forming a surface with adsorbates. First we form two clean surfaces by cleaving the bulk, then allow adsorption to occur on the surfaces.
[[./images/adsorbate-surface-energy.png]]

Let us presume the surfaces are symmetric, and that each surface contributes half of the energy change. The overall change in energy:

$\Delta E = E_{slab,ads} - E_{ads} - E_{bulk}$

where the the energies are appropriately normalized for the stoichiometry. Let us rearrange the terms, and add and subtract a constant term $E_{slab}$.

$\Delta E = E_{slab,ads} - E_{slab} - E_{ads} - E_{bulk} + E_{slab}$

We defined $\gamma_{clean} = \frac{1}{2A}(E_{slab} - E_{bulk})$, and we defined $H_{ads} = E_{slab,ads} - E_{slab} - E_{ads}$ for adsorption on a single side of a slab. In this case, there are adsorbates on both sides of the slab, so $E_{slab,ads} - E_{slab} - E_{ads} = 2 \Delta H_{ads}$. If we normalize by $2A$, the area for both sides of the slab, we get

$\frac{\Delta E}{2A} = \gamma = \gamma_{clean} + \frac{H_{ads}}{A}$

You can see here that the adsorption energy serves to stabilize, or reduce the surface energy, provided that the adsorption energy is negative.

Some final notes about the equations above:

- We were not careful about stoichiometry. As written, it is assumed there are the same number of atoms (not including the adsorbates) in the slabs and bulk, and the same number of adsorbate atoms in the slab and $E_{ads}$. Appropriate normalization factors must be included if that is not true.

- It is not necessary to perform a symmetric slab calculation to determine the effect of adsorption on the surface energy! You can examine $\gamma - \gamma_{clean}$ with knowledge of only the adsorption energies!

** Adsorbate vibrations

Adsorbates also have vibrational modes. Unlike a free molecule, the translational and rotational modes of an adsorbate may actually have real frequencies. Sometimes they are called frustrated translations or rotations. For metal surfaces with adsorbates, it is common to only compute vibrational modes of the adsorbate on a frozen metal slab. The rationale is that the metal atoms are so much heavier than the adsorbate that there will be little coupling between the surface and adsorbates. You can limit the number of modes calculated with constraints (func:ase.constraints.FixAtoms or func:ase.constraints.FixScaled) if you use [[incar:IBRION][IBRION]]=5. The other IBRION settings (6, 7, 8) do not respect the selective dynamics constraints. Below we consider the vibrational modes of an oxygen atom in an fcc site on Pt(111).

#+RESULTS:



There are three modes for the free oxygen atom. One of them is a mode normal to the surface (the one with highest frequency. The other two are called frustrated translations. Note that we did not include the surface Pt atoms in the calculation, and this will have an effect on the result because the O atom could be coupled to the surface modes. It is typical to neglect this coupling because of the large difference in mass between O and Pt.  Next we look at the difference in results when we calculate all the modes.

Note that now there are 39 modes, which is 3*N where N=13 atoms in the unit cell. Many of the modes are low in frequency, which correspond to slab modes that are essentially phonons. The O frequencies are not that different from the previous calculation (497 vs 512 cm$^{-1}$. This is why it is common to keep the slab atoms frozen.

Calculating these results took 39*2 finite differences. It took about a day to get these results on a single CPU. It pays to use constraints to minimize the number of these calculations.

Note that we have one imaginary mode. This corresponds to the motion of the O atom falling into one of the neighboring 3-fold sites. It also indicates this position is not a stable minimum, but rather a saddle point. This position is a transition state for hopping between the fcc and hcp sites.

** Surface Diffusion barrier

See this review cite:ANIE.ANIE200602223 of diffusion on transition metal surfaces.

*** Standard nudged elastic band method
Here we illustrate a standard NEB method. You need an initial and final state to start with. We will use the results from previous calculations of oxygen atoms in an fcc and hcp site. then we will construct a band of images connecting these two sites. Finally, we let VASP optimize the band and analyze the results to get the barrier.

We should compare this barrier to what we could estimate from the simple adsorption energies in the fcc and bridge sites. The adsorption energy in the fcc site was -1.04 eV, and in the bridge site was -0.49 eV. The difference between these two is 0.55 eV, which is very close to the calculated barrier from the NEB calculation. In cases where you can determine what the transition state is, e.g. by symmetry, or other means, it is much faster to directly compute the energy of the initial and transition states for barrier determinations. This is not usually possible though.

*** Climbing image NEB
One issue with the standard NEB method is there is no image that is exactly at the transition state. That means there is some uncertainty of the true energy of the transition state, and there is no way to verify the transition state by vibrational analysis. The climbing image NEB method cite:henkelman:9901 solves that problem by making one image climb to the top. You set [[incar:LCLIMB][LCLIMB]]==True= in =Vasp= to turn on the climbing image method. Here we use the previous calculation as a starting point and turn on the climbing image method.

*** Using vibrations to confirm a transition state
A transition state should have exactly one imaginary degree of freedom which corresponds to the mode that takes reactants to products. See [[*Vibrations%20of%20the%20bridge%20site][Vibrations of the bridge site]] for an example.

** TODO Diffusion rates with transition state theory :noexport:

** TODO Effects of electric fields on adsorbates :noexport:
Electric fields can polarize adsorbates, i.e. shift their electron density around, which changes their stability . We can model this to some extent in VASP. We have to set the incar:EFIELD parameter to specify the field strength (in V/\AA), and incar:LDIPOL to =True=, and finally specify which lattice vector the field should be applied to with incar:IDIPOL. Usually, incar:IDIPOL will be set to 3 for surfaces so it points in the direction of the third lattice vector, which is conventionally in the z-direction and normal to the surface.

We will illustrate the effect using an example from cite:doi-10.1021/jp810518x for the effect of electric field on the adsorption energy of a CO molecule on Pt(111) at 0.25 ML. For simplicity, we will use a frozen slab, with the CO molecule in the geometry reported in that reference.

This is clearly a big effect! Between 500-600K, the energy has dropped by nearly 1 eV.

Pressure also affects the free energy. In the ideal gas limit, the pressure changes the free energy by $k T \ln P/P_0$ where $P_0$ is the standard state pressure (1 atm or 1 bar depending on the convention chosen). Let us see how this affects the free energy at different temperatures.

Similarly, you can see that simply changing the pressure has a large effect on the Gibbs free energy of an ideal gas through the term: $kT\ln(P/P_0)$, and that this effect is also temperature dependent. This leads us to the final formula we will use for the chemical potential of oxgyen:

$\mu_{O_2} = E_{O_2}^{DFT} + E_{O_2}^{ZPE} + \Delta \mu (T) + kT \ln(P/P_0)$

We can use $\mu_{O_2}$ in place of $E_{O_2}$ everywhere to include the effects of pressure and temperature on /the gas phase/ energy. If T=0K, and P=1 bar, we are at standard state, and this equation reduces to the DFT energy (+ the ZPE).

** Bulk phase stability of oxides

We will consider the effects of oxygen pressure and temperature on the formation energy of Ag_{2}O and Cu_{2}O. For now, we neglect the effect of pressure and temperature on the solid phases. Neglecting pressure is pretty reasonable, as the solids are not that compressible, and we do not expect the energy to change for small pressures. For neglecting the temperature, we assume that the temperature dependence of the oxide is similar to the temperature dependence of the metal, and that these dependencies practically cancel each other in the calculations. That is an assumption, and it may not be correct.

$2Cu + 1/2 O_2 \rightarrow Cu_2O$

In atomistic thermodynamics, we define the free energy of formation as:

$G_f = G_{Cu_2O} -2G_{Cu} - 0.5 G_{O_2}$

We will at this point assume that the solids are incompressible so that $p\Delta V \approx 0$, and that $S_{Cu_2O} -2S_{Cu} \approx 0$, which leads to $G_{Cu_2O} -2G_{Cu} \approx E_{Cu_2O} -2E_{Cu}$, which we directly compute from DFT. We express $G_{O_2} = \mu_{O_2} = E_{O_2}^{DFT} + E_{O_2}^{ZPE} + \Delta \mu (T) + kT \ln(P/P_0)$. In this example we neglect the zero-point energy of the oxygen molecule, and finally arrive at:

$G_f \approx E_{Cu_2O} -2E_{Cu} - 0.5 (E_{O_2}^{DFT} + \Delta \mu (T) + kT \ln(P/P_0))$

Which, after grouping terms is:

$G_f \approx E_{Cu_2O} -2E_{Cu} - 0.5 (E_{O_2}^{DFT}) - 0.5*\Delta \mu_{O_2}(P,T)$

with $\Delta \mu_{O_2}(P,T) = \Delta \mu (T) + kT \ln(P/P_0)$. We get $\Delta \mu (T)$ from the Janaf Tables, or the NIST Webbook.

- we are explicitly neglecting all entropies of the solid: configurational, vibrational and electronic

- we also neglect enthalpic contributions from temperature dependent electronic and vibrational states

You will recognize in this equation the standard formation energy we calculated in [[Metal oxide oxidation energies][Metal oxide oxidation energies ]]plus a correction for the non standard state pressure and temperature ($\Delta \mu_{O_2}(P,T) = 0$ at standard state).


$G_f \approx H_f - 0.5*\Delta \mu_{O_2}(P, T)$


The [[http://materialsproject.org/materials/361/][formation energy]] of Cu_{2}O is -1.9521 eV/formula unit. The [[http://materialsproject.org/materials/353/][formation energy]] for Ag_{2}O is -0.99 eV/formula unit. Let us consider what temperature the oxides decompose at a fixed oxygen pressure of 1$\times 10^{-10}$ atm. We need to find the temperature where:

$H_f = 0.5*\Delta \mu_{O_2}(P, T)$

which will make the formation energy be 0.

This graph shows graphically the $\Delta \mu_{O_2}$ required to make the metal more stable than the oxide. Anything less than about -2 eV will have the metal more stable. That can be achieved by any one of the following combinations (graphically estimated from Figure ref:fig:mu-o2):

** Effect on adsorption
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       6b509064-8e9d-44a0-ad86-f1302988c875
   :END:
We now consider the question: Given a pressure and temperature, what coverage would you expect on a surface? We saw earlier that adsorption energies depend on the site and coverage. We lso know the coverage depends on the pressure and temperature. Above some temperature, desorption occurs, and below some pressure adsorption will not be favorable. We seek to develop a quantitative method to determine those conditions.

We redefine the adsorption energy as:

$\Delta G_{ads} \approx E_{slab, ads} - E_{slab} - \mu_{ads}$

where again we neglect all contributions to the free energy of the slabs from vibrational energy and entropy, as well as configurational entropy if that is relevant. That leaves only the pressure and temperature dependence of the adsorbate, which we treat in the ideal gas limit.

We expand $\mu_{ads}$ as $E_{ads}+\Delta \mu(T,p)$, and thus:

$\Delta G_{ads} \approx E_{slab, ads} - E_{slab} - E_{ads} -\Delta \mu(T,p)$

or

$\Delta G_{ads} \approx \Delta H_{ads} -\Delta \mu(T,p)$

where $\Delta H_{ads}$ is the adsorption energy we defined earlier. Now we can examine the effect of $\Delta \mu(T,p)$ on the adsorption energies. We will use the adsorption energies for the oxygen on Pt(111) system we computed earlier:

** Atomistic therodynamics and multiple reactions

In cite:Inoglu2009188 we considered multiple reactions in an atomistic thermodynamic framework. Let us consider these three reactions of dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and hydrogen disulfide, and consider how to compute the reaction energy for the third reaction.

1. $H_2 + 2* \leftrightharpoons 2H*$

2. $H_2S + 2* \leftrightharpoons H* + SH*$

3. $SH* + * \leftrightharpoons S* + H*$

The reaction energy of interest is $E_{rxn} = \mu_{S*} + \mu{H*} - \mu{SH*}$ The question is, what are these chemical potentials? We would like them in terms of pressures and temperature, preferrably of molecules that can be approximated as ideal gases. By equilibrium arguments we can say that $\mu_{H*} = \frac{1}{2} \mu_{H_2}$. It follows that at equilibrium:

$\mu_{H*} + \mu_{SH*} = \mu_{H_2S}$ and $\mu_{H*} + \mu_{S*} = \mu_{SH*}$.

From the first equation we have:

$\mu_{SH*} = \mu_{H_2S} - \frac{1}{2}\mu_{H_2}$

and from the second equation we have:

$\mu_{S*} = \mu_{SH*} - \mu_{H*} = \mu_{H_2S} - \mu_{H_2}$.

Thus, the chemical potentials of all these three adsorbed species depend on the chemical potentials of two gas-phase species. The chemical potentials of each of these gases can be defined as:

$\mu_{gas}(T,p) = E_{gas}(0K) + \delta \mu + kT\ln\left (p/p^0\right )$, as we have defined before, so that only simple DFT calculations are needed to estimate them.

: U = 4.0  reaction energy = -3.653819
: U = 6.0  reaction energy = -3.397605

In cite:PhysRevB.73.195107, the difference in reaction energy from U=2 eV to U=4 eV was about 0.5 eV (estimated from graph). Here we see a range of 0.48 eV from U=2 eV to U=4 eV. Note that for U=0 eV, we had a (corrected reaction energy of -3.96 eV). Overall, the effect of adding U decreases this reaction energy.

This example highlights the challenge of using an approach like DFT+U. On one hand, U has a clear effect of changing the reaction energy. On the other hand, so does the correction factor for the O$_2$ binding energy. In cite:PhysRevB.73.195107 the authors tried to get the O$_2$ binding energy correction from oxide calculations where U is not important, so that it is decoupled from the non-cancelling errors that U fixes. See cite:PhysRevB.84.045115 for additional discussion of how to mix GGA and GGA+U results.

In any case, you should be careful to use well converged results to avoid compensating for convergence errors with U.

Van der Waal forces can play a considerable role in binding of aromatic molecules to metal surfaces [[http://th.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/site/uploads/Publications/PRL_submitted_2012063-582-586-2012.pdf][(ref)]]. Here we consider the effects of these forces on the adsorption energy of benzene on an Au(111) surface.First, we consider the regular PBE functional.

** Electron localization function
The electron localization function (ELF) can be used to characterize chemical bonds, e.g. their ionicity/covalency cite:silvi1994. Here we reproduce an example from Ref. citenum:silvi1994. We compute and plot the ELF for tetrafluoromethane. The incar:LELF tag turns this on.

This is a little negative compared to the literature but that could be due to the highly ordered structure we used.

** The BEEF functional in Vasp
In Vasp 5.3.5 it is possible to use the BEEF functional cite:wellendorff-2012-densit.

In Vasp, we just specify xc='beef-bdw' and Vasp takes care of the rest. This includes setting some addtional variables to setup van der Waals and to get the BEEF ensemble energies. Let us consider the dissociation energy of H_{2}.

It doesn't look like we have done much so far. How certain are we of the dissociation energy? Let us consider the ensemble of energies. In the calculation, an ensemble of functionals is used, and each one produces a different energy. We can look at the distribution of these energies to estimate the uncertainty in energy differences. We use the func:Vasp.get_beefens to get the ensemble. We calculate the uncertainty in our reaction energy by calculating the standard deviation of the appropriately weighted difference of ensembles.

Note that this ensemble represents the contribution just from the functionals, and not all the other contributions. So, the differences in the ensembles only represents that part of the uncertainty

#+RESULTS:
: mean = 0.00661973433552 eV

You can see the mean is nearly zero, suggesting the deviations are symmetrically distributed. The std error is 0.184 eV, which represents about a 68% confidence interval.

You need a specially patched version of Vasp.

First, we run our calculation in vacuum. We need this to get the WAVECAR. The following calculation mimics one of the example calculations in the Vaspsol package. The combination of nsw=0 and ibrion=2 does not make sense, but that is the example. I do not use the npar=4 parameter here.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from vasp import Vasp
from ase.structure import molecule

atoms = molecule('CO')
atoms.center(vacuum=5)

calc = Vasp('molecules/CO-vacuum',
            encut=600,
            prec='Accurate',
            ismear=0,
            sigma=0.05,
            ibrion=2,
            nsw=0,
            ediff=1e-6,
            atoms=atoms)
print(atoms.get_potential_energy())
print(atoms.get_forces())
print('Calculation time: {} seconds'.format(calc.get_elapsed_time()))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: -14.81547852
: [[ 0.     0.    -0.949]
:  [ 0.     0.     0.949]]
: Calculation time: 257.546 seconds

The forces are high because nsw was set to 0, so only one iteration was run.

Next, we do the solvation calculation. We use the default solvent dielectric constant of water, which is 80.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from vasp import Vasp

calc = Vasp('molecules/CO-vacuum')
calc.clone('molecules/CO-solvated')

calc.set(istart=1,  #
         lsol=True)
print(calc.get_atoms().get_potential_energy())
print(calc.get_atoms().get_forces())
print('Calculation time: {} seconds'.format(calc.get_elapsed_time()))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: -14.82289079
: [[ 0.     0.    -1.007]
:  [ 0.     0.     1.007]]
: Calculation time: 2937.72 seconds

Note these take quite a bit longer to calculate (e.g. 10 times longer)! The energies here are a little different than the vacuum result. To use this energy in an energy difference, you need to make sure the other energies were run with lsol=True also, and the same parameters.

Here is the evidence that we actually ran a calculation with solvation:

** Recipes
*** Modifying Atoms by deleting atoms
Sometimes it is convenient to create an Atoms object by deleting atoms from an existing object. Here is a recipe to delete all the hydrogen atoms in a molecule. The idea is to make a list of indices of which atoms to delete using list comprehension, then use list deletion to delete those indices.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import textwrap
from ase.structure import molecule

atoms = molecule('CH3CH2OH')
print(atoms)

# delete all the hydrogens
ind2del = [atom.index for atom in atoms if atom.symbol == 'H']
print('Indices to delete: ', ind2del)

del atoms[ind2del]

# now print what is left
print(atoms)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Atoms(symbols='C2OH6', positions=..., cell=[1.0, 1.0, 1.0], pbc=[False, False, False])
: Indices to delete:  [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
: Atoms(symbols='C2O', positions=..., cell=[1.0, 1.0, 1.0], pbc=[False, False, False])

*** Advanced tagging
We can label atoms with integer tags to help identify them later, e.g. which atoms are adsorbates, or surface atoms, or near an adsorbate, etc... We might want to refer to those atoms later for electronic structure, geometry analysis, etc...

The method uses integer tags that are powers of two, and then uses binary operators to check for matches. & is a bitwise AND. The key to understanding this is to look at the tags in binary form. The tags [1 2 4 8] can be represented by a binary string:

#+begin_example
1 = [1 0 0 0]
2 = [0 1 0 0]
4 = [0 0 1 0]
8 = [0 0 0 1]
#+end_example

So, an atom tagged with 1 and 2 would have a tag of [1 1 0 0] or equivalently in decimal numbers, a tag of 3.

*** Using units in ase
mod:ase uses a base set of atomic units.These are eV for energy, $\AA$ for distance, seconds for time, and amu for mass. Other units are defined in terms of those units, and you can easily convert to alternative units by dividing your quantity in atomic units by the units you want.

Not too many units are defined:
['A', 'AUT', 'Ang', 'Angstrom', 'Bohr', 'C', 'Debye', 'GPa', 'Ha', 'Hartree', 'J', 'Pascal', 'Ry', 'Rydberg', 'alpha', 'cm', 'eV', 'erg', 'fs', 'kB', 'kJ', 'kcal', 'kg', 'm', 'meV', 'mol', 'nm', 's', 'second']

It is not that hard to define your own derived units though. Note these  are only conversion factors. No units algebra is enforced (i.e. it will be ok to add a m and a kg)!

*** Extracting parts of an array

See http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/BuildingArrays for examples of making numpy arrays.


When analyzing numerical data you may often want to analyze only a part of the data. For example, suppose you have $x$ and $y$ data, (\(x\)=time, \(y\)=signal) and you want to integrate the date between a particular time interval. You can slice a numpy array to extract parts of it. See http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/Indexing for several examples of this.

In this example we show how to extract the data in an interval. We have $x$ data in the range of 0 to 6, and $y$ data that is the $\cos(x)$. We want to extract the $x$ and $y$ data for $2 < x < 4$, and the corresponding y-data. To do this, we utilize the numpy capability of slicing with a boolean array. We also show some customization of matplotlib.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :exports both

# http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/customizing.html

y = np.cos(x)

plt.plot(x, y, label='full')

ind = (x > 2) & (x < 4)

subx = x[ind]
suby = y[ind]

plt.plot(subx, suby, 'bo', label='sliced')
xlabel('x')
ylabel('cos(x)')

#+caption: Example of slicing out part of an array. The solid line represents the whole array, and the symbols are the array between $2 < x < 4$.
[[./images/np-array-slice.png]]
The expression \(x>2\) returns an array of booleans (True where the element of $x$ is greater than 2, and False where it is not) equal in size to $x$. Similarly \(x<4\) returns a boolean array where $x$ is less than 4. We take the logical =and= of these two boolean arrays to get another boolean array where both conditions are True (i.e. \(x<2\) and \(x>4\)). This final boolean array is =True= for the part of the arrays we are interested in, and we can use it to extract the subarrays we want.

*** Statistics

# Find 95% prediction interval for next measurement

alpha = 1.0 - 0.95

pred_interval = t.ppf(1 - alpha / 2., dof) * std_x * np.sqrt(1. + 1. / n)

s = ['We are 95% confident the next measurement',

*** Interpolation in 3D

You might ask, why would I need to interpolate in 3D? Suppose you want to plot the charge density along a line through a unit cell that does not correspond to grid points. What are you to do? Interpolate. In contrast to an abundance of methods for 1D and 2D interpolation, I could not find any standard library methods for 3D interpolation.

The principle we will use to develop an interpolation function in 3D is called trilinear interpolation, where we use multiple linear 1D interpolations to compute the value of a point inside a cube. As developed here, this solution only applies to rectangular grids. Later we will generalize the approach. We state the problem as follows:

We know a scalar field inside a unit cell on a regularly spaced grid. In VASP these fields may be the charge density or electrostatic potential for example, and they are known on the fft grids. We want to estimate the value of the scalar field at a point not on the grid, say P=(a,b,c).

Solution: Find the cube that contains the point, and is defined by points
    P1-P8 as shown in Figure ref:fig:trilinearpinterp.

[[./images/trilinear-interpolation.png]]

We use 1D interpolation formulas to compute the value of the scalar field at points I1 by interpolating between P1 and P2, and the value of the scalar field at I2 by interpolating between P3 and P4. In these points the only variable changing is x, so it is a simple 1D interpolation. We can then compute the value of the scalar field at I5 by interpolating between I1 and I2. We repeat the process on the top of the cube, to obtain points I3, I4 and I5. Finally, we compute the value of the scalar field at point P by interpolating between points I5 and I6. Note that the point I5 has coordinates (a,b,z1) and I6 is at (a,b,z2), so the final interpolation is again a 1D interpolation along z evaluated at z=c to get the final value of the scalar field at P=(a,b,c).

To generalize this to non-cubic cells, we need to do interpolation along arbitrary vectors. The overall strategy is the same:

    Find the cell that contains the point (a,b,c).
    compute the scaled coordinates (sa,sb,sc) of the point inside the cell.
    Do the interpolations along the basis vectors. Given u1 at P1(x1,y1,z1) and u2 at P2(x2,y2,z2) where (P2-P1) is a cell basis vector a, u = u1 + sa*(u2-u1). There are still 7 interpolations to do.

Below is an example of this code, using a the python library bisect to find the cell.

*** Reading and writing data

**** Built-in io modules

=pylab= has two convenient and powerful functions for saving and
reading data, func:pylab.save and func:pylab.load.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
pylab.save('pdat.dat',(x,y))
#+END_SRC

and later you can read these arrays back in with:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
x,y = pylab.load('pdat.dat')
#+END_SRC

see also func:pylab.csv2rec and func:pylab.loadtxt and
func:pylab.savetxt.

See http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/InputOutput for examples of numpy io.

**** From scratch

You can save data in many ways from scratch. Basically, just open a
file and write data to it. Likewise, any datafile that has some
structure to it can probably be read by python.

Let us consider a datafile with these contents:

#+begin_example
	#header
	#ignore these lines
	john, 4
	robert, 5
	terry, 5
#+end_example

A standard approach would be to read in all the lines, skip the first
two lines, split each line (remember each line is a string) at the
',', and append the first field to one variable, and append the second
field to another variable as an integer.  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
v1 = []
v2 = []
lines = open('somefile','r').readlines()

for line in lines[2:]: #skip the first two lines
    fields = line.split(',')
	v1.append(fields[0]) #names
	v2.append(int(fields[1])) #number
#+END_SRC

Writing datafiles is easy too.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
v1 = ['john', 'robert', 'terry']
v2 = [4,5,6]
f = open('somefile', 'w') #note 'w' = write mode
f.write('#header\n')
f.write('#ignore these lines\n')
for a,b in zip(v1,v2):
	f.write('{0}, {1}\n'.format(a,b))
f.close()
#+END_SRC

Some notes:
1. opening a file in 'w' mode clobbers any existing file, so do that
with care!
2. when writing to a file you have to add a carriage return to each line.
3. Manually writing and reading files is pretty tedious. Whenever
possible you should use the built-in methods of mod:numpy or mod:pylab.

*** Integration
Numerical integrations is easy with the numpy.trapz() method. Use it like this: func:numpy.trapz(y,x). Note that y comes first. y and x must be the same length.

Integration can be used to calculate average properties of continuous distributions. Suppose for example, we have a density of states, \rho as a function of energy E. We can integrate the density of states to find the total number of states:

$N_{states} = \int \rho dE$

or, in python:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
Nstates = np.trapz(rho,E)
#+END_SRC

where rho is a vector that contains the density of states at each energy in the vector E (vector here means a list of numbers).

The average energy of distribution is:

$E_{avg} = \frac{\int \rho E dE}{\int \rho dE}$

or, in python:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
e_avg = np.trapz(rho*E,E)/np.trapz(rho,E)
#+END_SRC

These last two examples are the zeroth and first moments of the density of states. The second moment is related to the width squared of the distribution, and the third and fourth moements are related to skewness and kurtosis of the distribution.

The nth moment is defined by:

$m_n = \frac{\int \rho*E^n dE}{\int \rho dE}$

To get the second moment of the density of states in python, we use::

#+BEGIN_SRC python
n = 2
mom_2 = np.trapz(rho*E**n,E)/np.trapz(rho,E)
#+END_SRC

*** Numerical differentiation
numpy has a function called func:numpy.diff that is similar to the one found in Matlab. It calculates the differences between the elements in your list, and returns a list that is one element shorter, which makes it unsuitable for plotting the derivative of a function.

**** Simple loops to define finite difference derivatives

Loops in python are pretty slow (relatively speaking) but they are usually trivial to understand. In this script we show some simple ways to construct derivative vectors using loops. It is implied in these formulas that the data points are equally spaced.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

These are the brainless way to calculate numerical derivatives. They

If your data is very noisy, you will have a hard time getting good derivatives; derivatives tend to magnify noise. In these cases, you have to employ smoothing techniques, either implicitly by using a multipoint derivative formula, or explicitly by smoothing the data yourself, or taking the derivative of a function that has been fit to the data in the neighborhood you are interested in.

Here is an example of a 4-point centered difference of some noisy data:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)
y = np.sin(x) + 0.1*np.random.random(size=x.shape)
dy_analytical = np.cos(x)

#2-point formula
dyf = [0.0]*len(x)
for i in range(len(y)-1):
    dyf[i] = (y[i+1] - y[i])/(x[i+1]-x[i])
#set last element by backwards difference
dyf[-1] = (y[-1] - y[-2])/(x[-1] - x[-2])

'''

The derivative is still noisy, but the four-point derivative is a little better than the two-pt formula.

**** FFT derivatives

It is possible to perform derivatives using fast fourier transforms (FFT):
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

N = 101 #number of points
L = 2*np.pi #interval of data

x = np.arange(0.0,L,L/float(N)) #this does not include the endpoint

#add some random noise
y = np.sin(x) + 0.05*np.random.random(size=x.shape)
dy_analytical = np.cos(x)

'''
http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.math/2008-05/msg00401.html

you can use fft to calculate derivatives!
'''

if N % 2 == 0:
    k = np.asarray(range(0,N/2)+[0] + range(-N/2+1,0))
else:
    k = np.asarray(range(0,(N-1)/2) +[0] + range(-(N-1)/2,0))

k *= 2*np.pi/L

fd = np.fft.ifft(1.j*k * np.fft.fft(y))

plt.plot(x,y)
plt.plot(x,dy_analytical,label='analytical der')
plt.plot(x,fd,label='fft der')

This example does not show any major advantage in the quality of the derivative, and it is almost certain I would never remember how to do this off the top of my head.

*** NetCDF files

[[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf][NetCDF]] is a binary,
but cross-platform structured data format.	The input file and
output file for Dacapo is the NetCDF format. On creating a NetCDF file
you must define the dimensions and variables before you can store data
in them. You can create and read NetCDF files in python using one of
the following modules:

mod:Scientific.IO.NetCDF
(http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython/)

mod:netCDF3 (http://netcdf4-python.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/netCDF3-module.html)

mod:pycdf (http://pysclint.sourceforge.net/pycdf/) this is a very
low level module modelled after the C-api. I am not sure it is completely
bug-free (I have problems with character variables)

*** Python modules
The comma separated values (mod:csv) module in python allows you to
easily create datafiles:

csv writing:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0.0,6.0,100)
y = np.cos(x)

import csv
writer = csv.writer(open("some.csv", "w"))
writer.writerows(zip(x,y))
#+END_SRC

It is not so easy to read the data back in though because the module
only returns strings, so you must turn the strings back into floats (or
whatever other format they should be).

csv reading:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import csv
reader = csv.reader(open("some.csv",'r'),delimiter=',')

x,y = [],[]
for row in reader:
#csv returns strings that must be cast as floats
    a,b = [float(z) for z in row]
    x.append(a)
    y.append(b)
#+END_SRC

This is almost as much work as manually reading the data though. The
module is more powerful than I have shown here, so one day checkout
=pydoc csv=.

The mod:pickle and mod:shelve modules of python also offer some
data storage functionality. Check them out some day too.

*** Writing and reading Excel files
**** Writing Excel files
It is sometimes convenient to do some analysis in Excel. We can create Excel files in python with mod:xlwt. Google this module if you need to do this a lot.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
import xlwt

wbk = xlwt.Workbook()
sheet = wbk.add_sheet('sheet 1')

volumes = np.array([13.72, 14.83, 16.0, 17.23, 18.52])
energies = np.array([-56.29, -56.41, -56.46, -56.46, -56.42])

for i, pair in enumerate(zip(volumes, energies)):
    vol = pair[0]
    energy = pair[1]
    sheet.write(i,0,vol)
    sheet.write(i,1,energy)
wbk.save('images/test-write.xls')
#+END_SRC

**** Reading Excel files
We can also read Excel files (even on Linux!) with mod:xlrd. Let us read in the data we just wrote. We wrote 5 volumes to column 0, and 5 energies to column 1.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import xlrd
wbk = xlrd.open_workbook('images/test-write.xls')
sheet1 = wbk.sheet_by_name('sheet 1')
print(sheet1.col_values(0))
print(sheet1.col_values(1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** Computational geometry
*** Changing coordinate systems
Let A, B, C be the unit cell vectors

\begin{eqnarray}
A = A1 x + A2 y + A3 z \\
B = B1 x + B2 y + B3 z \\
C = C1 x + C2 y + C3 z
\end{eqnarray}

and we want to find the vector $[s1, s2, s3]$ so that
\(P = s1 A + s2 B + s3 C \)

if we expand this, we get:

\begin{align*}
&s1 A1 x + s1 A2 y + s1 A3 z   \\
&+ s2 B1 x + s2 B2 y + s2 B3 z \\
&+ s3 C1 x + s3 C2 y + s3 C3 z = p1 x + p2 y + p3 z
\end{align*}

If we now match coefficients on x, y, and z, we can write a set of
linear equations as:

\begin{equation}
\left [ \begin{array}{ccc}
A1 & B1 & C1 \\
A2 & B2 & C2 \\
A3 & B3 & C3
\end{array}\right]
\left [ \begin{array}{c}
s1 \\
s2 \\
s3 \end{array}\right] =
\left [\begin{array}{c}
p1 \\ p2 \\ p3 \end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

# |A1 B1 C1| |s1|   |p1|
# |A2 B2 C2| |s2| = |p2|
# |A3 B3 C3| |s3|   |p3|

or, in standard form:

$A^T s = p$

and we need to solve for s as:

$s = (A^T)^{-1} \cdot p$

p must be a column vector, so we will have to transpose the positions
provided by the atoms class, and then transpose the final result to
get the positions back into row-vector form:

$s = ((A^T)^{-1} p^T)^T$

Here we implement that in code:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.lattice.surface import fcc111
import numpy as np
np.set_printoptions(precision=3,suppress=True)

slab = fcc111('Pd',
              a=3.92,       # Pd lattice constant
              size=(2,2,3), #3-layer slab in 1x1 configuration
              vacuum=10.0)

pos = slab.get_positions() #these positions use x,y,z vectors as a basis

# we want to see the atoms in terms of the unitcell vectors
newbasis = slab.get_cell()

s = np.dot(np.linalg.inv(newbasis.T),pos.T).T
print('Coordinates in new basis are: \n',s)

# what we just did is equivalent to the following atoms method
print('Scaled coordinates from ase are: \n',slab.get_scaled_positions())
#+END_SRC

 [ 0.     0.5    0.592]
 [ 0.5    0.5    0.592]]
#+end_example


The method shown above is general to all basis set transformations. We
examine another case next. Sometimes it is nice if all the coordinates
are integers. For this example, we will use the bcc primitive lattice
vectors and express the positions of each atom in terms of them. By
definition each atomic position should be an integer combination of
the primitive lattice vectors (before relaxation, and assuming one
atom is at the origin, and the unit cell is aligned with the primitive
basis!)

*** Unit cell properties
The volume of a unit cell can be calculated from $V = (a_1 \times a_2)
\cdot a_3$ where $a_1$, $a_2$ and $a_3$ are the unit cell vectors. It
is more convenient, however, to simply evaluate that equation as the
determinant of the matrix describing the unit cell, where each row of
the matrix is a unit cell vector.

   $V = |\det(ucell)|$

Why do we need to take the absolute value? The sign of the determinant
depends on the handedness of the order of the unit cell vectors. If
they are right-handed the determinant will be positive, and if they
are left-handed the determinant will be negative. Switching any two
rows will change the sign of the determinant and the
handedness. mod:ase implements a convenient function to get the
volume of an mod:Atoms object: func:ase.Atoms.get_volume.

Here are three equivalent ways to compute the unit cell volume.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

a3 = [0, 0, 10]

*** d-spacing
If you like to set up the vacuum in your slab calculations in terms of
equivalent layers of atoms, you need to calculate the d-spacing (which
is the spacing between parallel planes of atoms) for the hkl plane you
are using. The script below shows several ways to accomplish that.

** Equations of State

The module mod:ase.utils.eos uses a simple polynomial equation of
state to find bulk unit cell equilibrium volumes and bulk
modulus. There are several other choices you could use that are more
standard in the literature. Here we summarize them and provide
references to the relevant literature. In each of these cases we show equations for the energy as a function of volume, although sometimes the volume is transformed or normalized.

*** Birch-Murnaghan
This is probably the most common equation of state used most often,
and is a modification of the original Murnaghan EOS described below. A
current description of the equation is in reference
cite:PhysRevB.70.224107. You can also find the equations for the Vinet and
Poirier-Tarantola equations of state in that reference.

Birch-Murnaghan EOS:

   $E(\eta) = E_0 + \frac{9B_0 V_0}{16}(\eta^2-1)^2(6+B'_0(\eta^2-1)-4\eta^2)$

where $\eta=(V/V_0)^{1/3}$, $B_0$ and $B'_0$ are the bulk
modulus and its pressure derivative at the equilibrium volume
$V_0$. You may find other derivations of this equation in the
literature too.

Two other equations of state in that reference are the Vinet EOS:

   $E(\eta) = E_0 + \frac{2 B_0 V_0}{(B'_0-1)^2}(2-(5+3B'_0 (\eta-1) e^{-3(B'_0-1)(\eta-1)/2})$

and the Poirier-Tarantola EOS:

   $E(\varrho) = E_0 + \frac{B_0 V_0 \varrho^2}{6}(3 + \varrho (B'_0-2))$

with $\varrho=-3 \ln(\eta)$.

*** Murnaghan
The equation most often used in the Murnaghan  cite:Murnaghan1944
equation of state is described in citealp:PhysRevB.28.5480.


   $E = E_T+\frac{B_0 V}{B'_0}\left[\frac{(V_0/V)^{B'_0}}{B'_0-1}+1\right]-\frac{V_0 B_0}{B'_0-1}$

where $V$ is the volume, $B_0$ and $B'_0$ are the bulk
modulus and its pressure derivative at the equilibrium volume
$V_0$. All of these are parameters that are fitted to energy
vs. unit cell volume ($V$) data. When fitting data to this equation a
guess of 2-4 for $B'_0$ is usually a good start.

*** Birch


The original Birch equation cite:Birch is:


   $E = E_0 + \frac{9}{8} B_0 V_0 \left(\left(\frac{V_0}{V}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}-1\right)^2+\frac{9}{16} B_0 V_0 (B'_0-4)\left(\left(\frac{V}{V_0}\right)^{2/3}-1\right)^3$

*** The Anton-Schmidt Equation of state cite:Mayer200323

   $E(V) = E_\infty + \frac{B V_0}{n+1}\left(\frac{V}{V_0}\right)^{n+1} \left( \ln{\frac{V}{V_0}} - \frac{1}{n+1}\right)$

where $E_\infty$ corresponds to the energy at infinite separation,
although the model they use to derive this equation breaks down at
large separations so this is usually not a good estimate of the
cohesive energy. $n$ is typically about -2.

*** Fitting data to these equations of state
To use these equations of state to find the equilibrium cell volume
and bulk modulus we need a set of calculations that give us the energy
of the unit cell as a function of the cell volume. We then fit that
data to one of the above equations to extract the parameters we want.
All of these equations of state are non-linear in the cell volume,
which means you have to provide some initial guesses for the
parameters.

Here we describe a strategy for getting some estimates of the
parameters using a linear least squares fitting of a parabola to the
data to estimate $E_0$, $V_0$, $B$ and
$B'_0$ which are used as initial guess for a non-linear least
squares fit of the equation of state to the data.

The following example illustrates one approach to this problem for the
Murnaghan equation of state:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
'''Example of fitting the Birch-Murnaghan EOS to data'''

import numpy as np

# raw data from 2.2.3-al-analyze-eos.py
v = np.array([13.72, 14.83, 16.0, 17.23, 18.52])
e = np.array([-56.29, -56.41, -56.46, -56.46, -56.42])

#make a vector to evaluate fits on with a lot of points so it looks smooth
vfit = np.linspace(min(v),max(v),100)

### fit a parabola to the data
# y = ax^2 + bx + c
a,b,c = np.polyfit(v,e,2) #this is from pylab

'''
the parabola does not fit the data very well, but we can use it to get
some analytical guesses for other parameters.

V0 = minimum energy volume, or where dE/dV=0
E = aV^2 + bV + c
dE/dV = 2aV + b = 0
V0 = -b/2a

E0 is the minimum energy, which is:
E0 = aV0^2 + bV0 + c

B is equal to V0*d^2E/dV^2, which is just 2a*V0

and from experience we know Bprime_0 is usually a small number like 4
'''

#now here are our initial guesses.

You can see the Murnaghan equation of state fits the data better than
the parabola.

Here is a comparison of the initial guesses and final parameters. You
can see our guesses from the parabola were actually pretty good, and
are the main reason we converged to a solution. If you try other
guesses you will probably find the =scipy.optimize.leastsq= function
does not converge.

** Miscellaneous vasp/VASP tips
*** Using a special setup
VASP provides [[http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/vasp/PAW_potentials.html][special setups]] for some elements. The following guidelines tell you what is in a potential:

No extension means the standard potential. The following extensions mean:
#+ATTR_LaTeX: align= |l|p{10cm}|
#+caption: Meaning of extensions on POTCAR files for special setups.
| extension |                                                                                     |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _h        | means the potential is harder than the standard (i.e. needs a higher cutoff energy) |
| _s        | means the potential is softer than the standard (i.e. needs a lower cutoff energy)  |
| _sv       | $s$ and $p$ semi-core states are treated as valence states                          |
| _pv       | $p$ semi-core states are treated as valence states                                  |
| _d        | $d$ semi-core states are treated as valence states                                  |

Here are some links to information in the VASP manual for the setups.

Here we show how to select the O_sv potential in a calculation.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase import Atoms, Atom
from vasp import Vasp

atoms = Atoms([Atom('O',[5, 5, 5], magmom=1)],
             cell=(6, 6, 6))

calc = Vasp('molecules/O_s',

            ispin=2,
            ismear=0,
            sigma=0.001,
            setups=[['O', '_s']], # specifies O_s potential
            atoms=atoms)

print calc.potential_energy
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

How do you know you got the right special setup? We can look at the first line of the POTCAR file in the calculation directory to see.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports both
head -n 1 molecules/O_sv/POTCAR
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

This shows we indeed used the O_sv setup.

*** TODO Running vasp in parallel
vasp is smart. If you ask for more than one node, it will automatically try to run in parallel. On our cluster you have to use cores, i.e. (processor per node) not nodes due to a limitation in how vasp is compiled.

*** Running multiple instances of vasp in parallel
mod:vasp was designed to enable asynchronous, parallel running processes through a queuing system. This is ideal for submitting large numbers of independent calculations in one script. The design uses exceptions to exit the script if the results are not available for subsequent analysis. The design expects that you run the script often, and the results are analyzed only when they are finally available.

Sometimes it is convenient to run a set of calculations and then wait for them to finish so that a second set of calculations that depend on the first results can be run. In this scenario, it is inconvenient to have to rerun your script again after the first set of calculations is done.  The challenge is how to tell the computer to run a set of calculations in parallel, *and* wait for the calculations to finish. This can be achieved using the mod:multiprocessing module in python.

The principle idea is to set up the calculations you want to run, and use mod:multiprocessing to handle running them and waiting for you. To do this, you must instruct mod:vasp to use a "run mode", and construct a script with a function that runs a calculation, and a section that only runs in the "__main__" script.

The first time you run this you will get all the VASP output. The second time you get the smaller output above.

Also, I have not figured out how to integrate this method with the queue system. At the moment, the runvasp.py script which ultimately runs VASP will run VASP in parallel, i.e. one process on multiple nodes/cores instead of a single job that runs multiple processes simultaneously on multiple nodes/cores.
#+end_note

Here is an example of running this through the queue. The main variations are you must set several variables in =VASPRC= that indicate you want to use mod:multiprocessing, and you must save the script and submit manually to the queue with matching parameters. This is not 100% satisfying, but it is the best that I have found for now.

** Hy
Here is our prototypical python script.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase import Atoms, Atom
from vasp import Vasp

co = Atoms([Atom('C', [0, 0, 0]),
            Atom('O', [1.2, 0, 0])],
           cell=(6., 6., 6.))

calc = Vasp('molecules/simple-co',  # output dir
            xc='pbe',  # the exchange-correlation functional
            nbands=6,    # number of bands
            encut=350,    # planewave cutoff
            ismear=1,    # Methfessel-Paxton smearing
            sigma=0.01,  # very small smearing factor for a molecule
            atoms=co)

print('energy = {0} eV'.format(co.get_potential_energy()))
print(co.get_forces())
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: energy = -14.69111507 eV
: [[ 5.09138064  0.          0.        ]
:  [-5.09138064  0.          0.        ]]

We can also use hy-lang for these scripts. Hy is a Lisp that works with Python. You need this in your Emacs setup (mile-hy is part of jmax).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'auto-complete)
(require 'mile-hy)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: mile-hy

And here is the same script in hy.

#+BEGIN_SRC hy
(import [ase [Atom Atoms]])
(import [vasp [Vasp]])

(setv co (Atoms [(Atom "C" [0.0 0.0 0.0])
                 (Atom "O" [1.2 0.0 0.0])]
                :cell [6.0 6.0 6.0]))

(setv calc (Vasp "molecules/simple-co-hy"
                 :xc "pbe"
                 :nbands 6
                 :encut 350
                 :ismear 1
                 :sigma 0.01
                 :atoms co))

(print (.format "energy = {0} eV"
                (.get_potential_energy co)))

(print (. calc potential_energy))
; (print (.potential_energy calc)) ;; not ok
(print (.get_forces co))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: energy = -14.69111507 eV
: -14.69111507
: [[ 5.09138064  0.          0.        ]

* Python
** pip as a user
pip is pretty easy to install as a user.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install --user some-package
#+END_SRC

For me this installs here:

~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages

That may or may not be on your Python path.

** Integer division math gotchas
It pays to be careful when dividing by integers because you can get unexpected results if you do not know the integer division rules. In python 2.6, if you divide two integers, you get an integer! This is usually not a problem if there is no emainder in the division, e.g. 6/3=2. But, if there is a remainder, and that remainder is important, you will lose it. Here is an example of calculating the mole fraction of a species from integer numbers of atoms in the unit cell. If you are not careful, you get the wrong answer! You can convert (also called casting) a number to a float using the float command.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
nPd = 4
nCu = 5
x_Cu = nCu/(nPd + nCu)
print('x_cu = {0} (integer division)'.format(x_Cu))

# now cast as floats
x_Cu = float(nCu)/float(nPd + nCu)
print('x_cu = {0} (float division)'.format(x_Cu))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: x_cu = 0 (integer division)
: x_cu = 0.555555555556 (float division)

Note that if one of the numbers is a float, python will automatically cast the integer as a float, and return a float.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
nPd = 4
nCu = 5

# now cast as floats
x_Cu = float(nCu)/(nPd + nCu)
print('x_cu = {0}'.format(x_Cu))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: x_cu = 0.555555555556

Finally, you can tell python a number is a float by adding a decimal to it. You do not need to put a 0 after the decimal, but you can.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
nPd = 4.  # this is a float
nCu = 5

x_Cu = nCu / (nPd + nCu)
print('x_cu = {0}'.format(x_Cu))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: x_cu = 0.555555555556

     <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
